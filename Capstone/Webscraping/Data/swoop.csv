About a week in to my trip I received a message that my flight was cancelled. I was forced to move to june 1st. This didn't work for me but I had no choice. They gave no explanation at all. Today April 29th, 2020, I got another message that my rescheduled flight was cancelled again and I can take the same day flight but instead of direct and a 2.5 hour flight it goes to a transferred flight and a 10 hour flight.

Swoop emailed stating that if we re-booked with an alternate carrier they would reimburse us. Four months later we are now being told that because we did not re-book with Westjet (the only approved alternate carrier) we will not be reimbursed. Their email specifically states that we can book with an 'alternate carrier'. It does not say that the alternate carrier had to be Westjet, yet that is why we are being denied our refund.

We could not get a hold of anyone at Swoop for any advice as to what to do - just a recording saying they were too busy to take calls not even a option to leave a contact phone number to have them call me back. I ended up paying over $600 for 2 of us to get back to Edmonton. Now our regular tickets that were for Mar 23 are lost with no option even for a credit that we could use later.

This airline should not be getting a dime from the government when it is not refunding or given full credits to the people that have their flights canceled.

Our flight from Mesa to Edmonton and the return flight in May were cancelled due to the Coronavirus outbreak and subsequent closing of the U.S./Canada border. We are now unable to travel to Canada and Swoop refuses to issue anything other than Swoop credit. Edmonton is the only destination they fly to out of Mesa - lot of good credit will do. They seem to feel entitled to my money while not providing anything on their end. I understand the outbreak is outside their control but a simple refund is appropriate for this unusual situation.

swoop,T Meissan,2020-03-26,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hamilton to Halifax. I have flown Swoop many times in the past few years, but have seen a real shift in their customer service. In light of a global pandemic, I was appalled at a couple of practices that seemed like safety oversights that negate the government mandate for social distancing.  When time to board, they called ""General Boarding Call"", instead of by zone or by row, which resulted in all passengers cramming up to the counter. The plane was 1/2 full, but their seating algorithm placed everyone at the back of the plane (because they want to charge extra for seats up front). Both of these areas could easily be improved at times like this: Stagger boarding, back of plane to front. Wave seating fees and aim to have 1 person per row, or at least seats between them.

I tried contacting an agent through the Swoop website to no avail. Never received a response to my written request to Swoop. What I find disturbing is the complete lack of care to help customers deal with flagrant issues. Swoop is a subsidiary of Westjet, one of the more popular and successful air carriers in Canada. I have never had an issue in all the years I have flown Westjet. How is it Westjet has not become involved with Swoop management to iron out these customer complaints?

There is no In-flight entertainment, there is a Swoop app that you can download, which has a streaming service there, which you need to pay for WiFi to use.  Ended up paying nearly 15 bucks for the in-flight WiFi which didn't work for me. Couldn't connect to anything that wasn't on the Swoop website.

When one person finally came, she said they don't check in anymore. The flight is here hardly anyone in the airport and they didn't check in us while at 11:40 neither of them was in counter. It is not our fault that they left the counter earlier than usual times because they didn't have any travelers. The supervisor was not responsive and just kept showing a paper with a phone number. Is this called customer service? I tried to call many times and no one is responsive. This is not fair to customers.

Perhaps a credit? Shouldn’t this be an exception? WestJet and Air Canada are also credit or refunding customers. Even the government is paying people to stay at home and not travel.

swoop,D Long,2020-03-08,"✅ Trip Verified |  This past year has certainly been a challenge for Swoop. Nevertheless, despite the complaints, my wife and I decided to abandon our loyalty to Westjet over the past 15 years and try Swoop. Having the pleasure to live only 15 minutes from the Hamilton airport, and a reduced price, were key factors in our decision. We booked our February vacation to Jamaica last September and have been watching the reviews on a daily basis. Although the company has had some trying times, it's fair to say that even new companies have hiccups along the way.  We booked our flight for February 8th, flying out of Hamilton to Mo Bay. Our crew on flight WO672 went beyond what we as a customer expect. Not only did they do their best to make you comfortable, they were efficient, friendly, smiles all around and courteous. Best decision we made. On our return flight which was February 29th flight WO673, once again we had a very smooth flight home. We had a different crew on board this time - friendly, professional employees. I want to thank the crew of both flights, for providing such great customer service.  Not only did we save on the airfare, we saved on the transportation to Pearson as well, and we had a fantastic flight.

I get to Hamilton airport and find out my flight will be delayed an additional 10 minutes making it a 9:40 departure. No problem, we will still make it to our event, we were feeling sorry for the Domestic flight before us with swoop that was cancelled. 9:43pm rolls around and the screens say my flight has departed. What the fuck? Nope the staff say it has just arrived and they are preparing it for us. After all other flights from Hamilton & Toronto have departed these guys announce that our flight has been cancelled. Chaos broke in that tiny airport. None of the staff had any information to give. Helpful really at 10:30 at night. So we are exhausted and angry now. We were told everyone would receive a 100% refund if we chose not to fly on the next available flight. That flight is 24 hours away and means we not only miss out on tonight’s hotel that we have paid for (which I later found out was due to mechanical issues) but we would also miss the UFC. We booked another flight with another reputable airline that actually flies passengers and doesn’t just rob them and cancel flights. I got the email that I supposedly could “accept changes” or “cancel” and get a full refund. The icing on the cake, I cannot cancel my booking and get a refund at all. It’s simply not an option.

After we all shuffled over, they only processed the one line and held everyone else. The line was backed up out the doors of the terminal.

Finally after all this, we still made it to gate, they said they cannot let us board since gates are closed. Just turned their back, did not help to find alternative flight or could have let us in.

I showed up 105 mins early and missed my flight from Edmonton which I understand is my fault for not showing up before the recommended 120 mins. That was only the start to my troubles with swoop. I booked another flight with Westjet down to phoenix and still had my return flight with swoop home. Swoop sent me an email on the Friday (day after missed flight) stating if I did not reply to it within 24 hours they would cancel my prepaid return flight. I had lost my phone and had no way to reply to this message. I did my due diligence to check my emails Monday, two days before my flight, but it was already cancelled. So panicking I checked swoops flights and there was an opening on the same flight heading home. I called them asap and was charged $15 and put on hold for well over an hour. When I got ahold of the airline I explained my situation and asked if they could undo the cancellation. They said they could not undo the cancellation and requested I re-purchase the same flight home. I phoned again when I returned to Edmonton and asked if they could refund my prepaid luggage or the cancelled return flight however they held the fine print of there service agreement against me and would not even hand out a coupon to save on another swoop flight.

swoop,E Halsen,2020-02-08,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cancun to Hamilton. We love Swoop. We have flown with them out of Hamilton approx 5 times in the last 2 years to Edmonton and Cancun. We’ve been delayed on 2 occasions (1-2hrs) but it didn’t bother us since we have reasonable expectations for a small budget airline. All the other times they were exactly on time was like a bonus! I’ve been delayed multiple times with Sunwing(2-6hrs), and delayed on occasion with AC and even WJ. It happens. Also to note we have flown with and without kids, check in counter staff has always been great. I have had no issues with Swoops booking system, online check in or the app. All easy and good. Each and every flight has been very smooth. As a private pilot, I can appreciate when I notice them avoiding the turbulent patches. Every single landing with them has been smooth despite landing (or taking off) in high winds in Mexico, Edmonton, or even freezing rain Last night coming in to Hamilton.  And we always are flying in the wild winter season. Yes some of their flight attendants can be young as mentioned in a review here but they are polite, thoughtful and always smiling. I also like how this airline doesn’t allow people to jump around to free open seats without paying and how they don’t offer complimentary menu items. This means they are not in the aisle blocking for an extended time and it really diminishes unnecessary garbage for 200 people that want a little plastic glass of pop just to throw out 5 minutes later. Instead pay $1.99 for a pop can if you really want it and then we are all more responsible - not so wasteful. ",Family Leisure,Economy Class,9,4,4,,,5,5,yes

Seats were surprisingly comfy for the price paid and they even had in seat chargers! Cabin crew very friendly and aircraft somewhat clean. If you’re traveling swoop just read about all the extra fees ahead of time and plan and add it to your total cost. But for the extremely cheap base fare I paid I was very happy with the service I got even if everything else was extra, I only paid for what I needed and it all worked out.

swoop,M Keale,2020-01-25,"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew out of Abbotsford January 15/20 to Mazatlan. There was a three hour delay which is understandable with the amount of snow that day. That’s not where my issue is, mine is with one particular flight attendant. The only male attendant whose name unfortunately I didn’t get. We chose to pay extra and took first row seating, mine was the aisle seat. Every single time he passed by me he bumped into me with either his hip or the beverage cart, every single time. No ‘excuse me’ or apology, Not once. Even the final time when he swung his arms while going by and knocking everything off of my fold-away tray to the floor, no acknowledgement or apology. And of course no attempt to pick anything up. It’s not as if I was hanging out into the aisle, those trays are positioned directly in front of the seat and do not extend into the aisle. With the cost of extras like seat selection and baggage fees, the price ends up being very close to a much more reputable airline. I doubt I’d use Swoop again and certainly wouldn’t recommend it to anyone after having such a bad taste left. I understand people can have a bad day, but please, if you’re at work in a customer service position, sometimes you have to suck it up and try to be pleasant.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,3,1,1,,3,1,no
swoop,D Calman,2020-01-23,✅ Trip Verified |  Mazatlan to Abbotsford. Do not fly this airline and expect anything resembling customer service. Due to weather we were rerouted to Edmonton. We were supposed to land in Abbotsford at 9:05 pm. Due to the change we arrived at 3:30 in the morning. Abbotsford is in the middle of nowhere as regards transportation. There was no Swoop representative on hand to assist with transportation problems. Lucky for me I found someone who was willing to share a taxi to Vancouver as the first bus wasn't until after 8 a.m. This cost me $90.00 on top of the ebus ticket that I had prepaid and was unable to use. I appreciate that they rerouted us due to landing difficulties. I did not appreciate the lack of information about the change; the use of a standard landing speech as opposed to an informative speech about what to do; the lack of preparedness in Edmonton and the lack of a representative at our final destination. I filed a complaint using their online method January 11th and a week and a half later have received no contact from their service department.

The next day I emailed and messaged with no response and then I called and waited just over an hour to have my call answered. When I told the person about the situation they talked to someone and got back to me saying that it was not possible to refund me. It might have been possible if I had contacted them within 24 hours but now was too late. I tried to speak to a manager but was not given that option. When I said that no one had returned my numerous messages or email the response was that they had been very busy and could not get back to everyone in a timely manner. I asked if eventually I would get a response and was assured that eventually my message would be responded to. When I said that if I had been able to speak to someone right after I had made the mistake it would have been helpful because I could have taken care of rebooking my flights. I assumed that that given the mistake and given that I had messaged to cancel the baggage right after I booked the flight that it would be reasonable to refund the baggage payment.

swoop,Tamara Seapy,2020-01-12,"Not Verified |  Swoop cancelled our flight And they are attributing it to the rain hamilton is getting. This was after delaying twice before the rain even started, which was made extra questionable when we were told to book with other airlines that were still flying in to Hamilton regardless of weather and at an increased fee (because seats that were $400 a month ago at westjet today were $1200+). In addition, some passengers, including myself, were not sent the notification until we were already in route. I incurred a $80+ cab fare as a result of Swoops inability to effectively communicate or manage their issues as it clearly wasn’t weather. At customer service we were all told we would be put on the next flight (a lie as there were flights for sale on their webpage sooner), that Swoop would reimburse for additional fees incurred by getting last minute flights with other agents etc - essentially anything they could say to be rid of us.  I am currently taking my second $80+ cab ride in 5 hrs because of Swoops poor customer service. I will never fly Swoop again if someone at this company doesn’t rectify costs incurred for their errors.

The communication between pilots and staff is horrendous. I am so disappointed, i will never fly through swoop again. It's like a bunch of children running a business. I would ask to be compensated but seeing how this business is ran I highly doubt they could organize anything. I'm so disappointed. ",Business,Economy Class,1,1,1,,,1,1,no
swoop,James Sharrat,2020-01-01,"Not Verified |  Hamilton to Winnipeg to see my family for Christmas. The day we were leaving we were informed that our flight was delayed due to weather, they delayed our flight by at least 4 hours, the last time we were notified of a delay was due to unscheduled plane maintenance. The first time they informed us was due to weather and the third time was due to the maintenance issue .. so which one was it? On our returning flight we were notified at 5am that our return flight was delayed 4 hours again due to weather, the weather in Hamilton was fine as there was nothing on the radar and our family in Ontario said it was fine there as well. We put off our driving as it is a 5 hour drive to the airport from where my family is. Our flight was delayed twice and our new departure time was at 10:15 PM. As we are driving into the airport parking lot I checked flight status only to find out our flight was canceled, my wife not not receive a notification until we were in the check in line. They said they will not cover a hotel room due to it being because of weather, due to the new laws I suspect that they are just saying this so that they dont have to reimburse you for your trouble, they will give you the option to reschedule or get a refund, if you have somewhere that you have to be last minute flights are not cheap so you are pretty much at their mercy unless you want to spend 1000 dollars to keep your schedule on track. This is not the first time that this has happened to us on swoop but it will the last time that we fly with the airline. ",Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,,,1,1,no
swoop,S Megan ,2019-12-31,"Not Verified |  Worst experience ever! I have two young kids. We paid for a flight back to Hamilton from Tampa Bay and the plane couldn’t land because of high winds. So we had to fly to Montreal. We have now been stuck at the airport for over 5 hours since landing and counting, and they emailed us to say they are providing us with two shuttle busses. There are about 300 people that need a bus. Their email stated first come first serve. ",Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,no
swoop,B Edmond,2019-12-31,✅ Trip Verified | Hamilton to Orlando with Swoop. Avoid like the plague. They are unreliable and you will end up with long delays and little to no communication. If I was offered free tickets I wouldn't take them. Had a 7.15am flight that was delayed and the flight was delayed 16 hours. The airline knew that plane had problems well in advance and choose to only let us know an hour before departure. I would wager this airline goes bankrupt very soon with this type of brutal service.,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
swoop,Deborah Beament,2019-12-31,✅ Trip Verified |  I booked 4 girls and myself a flight to Vegas for my 60th birthday. It was going to be an amazing long weekend. When we arrived at Hamilton airport the outside people were awesome. Grabbed my sister a wheelchair as she was on crutches. Lots of laughs about her going to Vegas on crutches. We got to the counter and asked if we could sit together. The check in attendant was noticeably grumpy. She told us no we could not sit together. I asked if there was a reason. She told us because of the way I booked. I booked all individually over a couple of days as I needed verification from my friends. I said is it possible to ask at the attendant at the check in counter prior to boarding. She said that would cause a problem and I asked why. She said because I’m going to be on the flight. I said ok. Well is the flight full and she said Yes. We board and the flight and there are tons of seats. Matter of fact we ended up sitting together and having entire rows all to ourselves. All five of us. Btw. She was not on our flight. We said nothing so we did not get her in trouble We never asked again about seating.  What is the point in lying to us. We were not loud or rowdy. We are 60 ish and expect more from a Canadian airline. Whoever you put out front can make or break our travel plan. We will go back to flying closer to home. Paying a little more and avoid Swoop.,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,3,5,5,5,,5,4,no
swoop,S Stevenson,2019-12-30,"✅ Trip Verified |  Winnipeg to Hamilton. Incredibly inconvenient! My flight was delayed by 9 hours! What was supposed to be a 9PM flight slowly but surely turned into a 6AM flight. What made it even more outrageous was the fact that I was traveling within my 5 year-old who was very sleepy for having to get up so early in the morning and because I had a 3 hour drive to bomanville once we landed. It's just annoying to have to contact my family and notify them of the delays, and luckily I got ahold of them before they started driving. The excuse for the delay was a staff rest? Don't schedule the staff if they're going to need that time to rest in the first place.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,2,3,3,1,1,1,2,no
swoop,Amanda Decotiis,2019-12-30,✅ Trip Verified |  I was scheduled for a flight to Hamilton From Florida. First off it was suppose to leave at 9pm then delayed to 9:30pm then 10:30pm then 11pm then 11:40 pm. We got no voucher for the inconvenience. When we were departing the captain said “let’s hope we land today” like what? Then as the flight went on it got quite bumpy which is fine but all of a sudden the captain says we are flying into Montreal because Hamilton is too dangerous. I looked at other airlines and they flew into the area 10 minutes later than we were suppose to. Swoop told us they would put us in a hotel for the night and to stay looking at our emails. Hours went by and we got no email about a hotel but we got an email that they have transportation coming and to continue looking at emails. Finally we get an email that they sent 2 buses for our airplane and another airplane which flew in from Halifax and they said it was first come first serve. ,Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,,,1,1,no
swoop,Stephen Bustard,2019-12-30,"Not Verified |  This is the worst airline. My daughter bought a ticket from Halifax to Hamilton. The plane started to Hamilton flew past Montreal and turned around because they didn’t have enough fuel to get to Hamilton. All passengers were told to get off plane in Montreal. When they disembarked, there was no representative at airport. They were told by pilot to call an 800 number after 8am. The plane landed in Montreal at 2:55am. They were sent an email saying a bus would drive them to Hamilton at 8am on a first come basis. After buses were full they would have to take a train or however they could get back to Hamilton. This airline should not even be in business. They have no right to do this to passengers. My daughter caught another flight with Porter airlines because I told her not to trust Swoop.

swoop,Warren Abbott,2019-12-27,"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought tickets on Swoop to fly from Edmonton to Orlando in feb 2020. Thought we were going to pay 800$, after thier hidden fees and charges ended up paying 1900$. Just in case I bought swoops insurance. Sure enough my company moved me to Pittsburgh from Edmonton and I cant use the tickets. Call Swoop, sorry no refund, no change of airport. Your insurance can just change the date. And thats 500$. I cant even just cancel myself and the family changes the date to make it easier or cheaper.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,,,,,,1,no

swoop,I Yaeger,2019-12-25,"Not Verified |  Hamilton to Winnipeg. No Customer service! First the flight was delayed by four hours. Then our luggage did not arrive. Worst thing, No Swoop personnel at the airport although a Swoop flight left an hour after we arrived. Airport information paged Swoop personnel and no one responded. At 10 p.m. Central time Swoop call centre is closed! Cheap flight not worth the hassle. Would not recommend this airline!",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2,1,2,,,1,1,no
swoop,A Passent,2019-12-24,"Not Verified |  Hamilton to Winnipeg. There should be warning before buying a ticket for this airline: it may cost you extra money, time and lack of sleep. If and when you fly, a flight attendant may tell you that you are lucky to fly at all. Absolute disaster in terms of service, completely disorganized operation, untrained unpleasant and even challenging staff posted there just to take as much money as they can get from you. Of course that is in a situation, would they provide flight and service. Don't be fooled by an initial cheap or a comparably cheaper price, this airline should be called greed.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,,,1,1,no
swoop,J Loftus,2019-12-23,✅ Trip Verified |  Hamilton to Orlando. I’m writing this from the tarmac where we’re enduring our eighth delay. I prepared to get up at 4 am to get here on time as they ask us to be two hours before international flight. Then the delays start piling up all with different reasons! People with paperwork need to go back to “the office” and will be back in 10 minutes. Now no answer. Just delays. They say we’re leaving in ten minutes and ten minutes later they say 15! Whatever we’re saving by avoiding Pearson (and I do not mind an extra drive to save money) it’s not worth it. The incompetence is next level. I feel like they’ve never done this before.,Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,,,1,1,no
swoop,Tannis Coleman,2019-12-23,✅ Trip Verified |  Winnipeg to Hamilton. Flight was changed from 9pm to 4am then again delayed to 6am. Extra charges are not making it as cheap as they claim. Food vouchers were given but unable to use because nothing open in airport not even a Tim's. The delay is Swoop staffing issues and they should not be offering flights if they cannot fulfill their duties. Not recommending or using Swoop again. Apparently they are notorious for this.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2,2,3,,,4,2,no

They have provided a date of December 22-27 which obviously we can’t go because of Christmas. They are refunding however not compensating for the fact we can no longer go on our flight. Also we booked cirque de Soleil tickets that are not refundable. This is the worst airline! They will not go above and beyond which to me is horrible customer service especially cancelling flights after waiting 3+ hours in the airport before cancelling it. I would not recommend this airline to anyone. What an inconvenience",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,1,,,,,1,1,no
