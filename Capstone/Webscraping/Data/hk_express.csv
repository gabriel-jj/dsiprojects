hk express,S Murten,2020-03-03,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Siem Reap. We flew during widespread fear about coronavirus and the flight was underbooked: the plane was only about 1/5 full. Nonetheless, the crew insisted on squishing everyone together because this airline wants to charge extra to sit apart from one another, even when extra seats are available.  As we were about to land, the flight attendant blasted the cabin with some sort of aerosol spray, which I'm sure is totally going to make up for the fact that we were sitting next to someone who was coughing the entire time. Will not be flying with them again.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,1,2,2,,,2,1,no

hk express,Chun Sing Poon,2020-01-27,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Osaka operated by A321. The sea is not comfortable and there is not headrest.  However, it is fine for budget airline and short haul flight. You need to pay for the food but it is acceptable because HK Express is a budget airline. Since the weather is bad, the plane suffered strong turbulence and became unstable. The plane suddenly decreased and many passengers felt panic.  The service from the crew is good, only thing that disappointed me is that the crew didn’t smile.

hk express,P James,2019-12-11,"✅ Trip Verified | Tokyo to Hong Kong. The plane landed safely and I would give them credit for that. The food I ordered was packaged in a cheap plastic container served as soon as we took off. I was expecting it to be dinner as the flight departs at 3 in the afternoon. Who orders a proper meal and eats at 3pm? I would say the majority would want their food to be served at dinner time. If I knew that I would have just brought a bento from the airport. Much better quality and cheaper. In addition to that, HK Express charged me HK$10 when I asked them to fill up my own bottle with water. No, despite the fact that I paid for U-first, a meal, and seat reservation. No they wanted $10 for tap water or else. It’s not that I really care about the money itself, but rather what if someone doesn’t have $ with them to pay for it, what if they don’t have a credit card with them while traveling (no, MasterCard debit doesn’t even work I tried. They take only credit)? Are you seriously just going to deprive of someone water that costs you next to nothing to give to them? For 5 or more hours? They know people can’t take water with them onto international flights unless you buy it after you get into the restricted area! Hence a lot of people don’t carry water with them. Luckily I had cash after their machine refused to take my travel debit. This is just pure corporate greedy over basic human necessities. I have never seen any airlines this greedy for money and would go to the extreme to charge people for tap water. Not bottled, tap! I wouldn’t be surprised if they started charging people to use toilet too. Look, if you are that greedy for money, at least price it into your tickets instead of charging people on the flight and slap them with a charge like this mid-flight alright? They are literally the worst airlines I have flown with. Yes that includes budget airlines. If you want cheap tickets, sure, just be prepared to bring everything with you including water. How are you going to get water through securities you ask? Well, you better figure out a way.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,2,1,1,2,5,no
hk express,JJ Lim,2019-12-11,"✅ Trip Verified | For a budget carrier, HK express is just about the best you can get. Do not expect frills, but they use new planes with new seats which are ergonomically designed and offer a reasonable amount of comfort and legroom while still being able to maximize revenue for the airline. I have flown several other routes other than this, namely HKG-FUK, HKG-CNX, HKG-BKK and HKG-HND and their service standards are consistently decent too. The cabin crew, despite representing a budget carrier, maintain the best of professional standards and carry the corporate image very well. HK Express boasts of a very extensive flight route network to various parts of Japan and that is another of their biggest competitive advantages. That said, their network around the rest of Asia is very respectable too.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,8,4,5,,,4,4,yes

Well, in terms of service, it was fantastic. I didn't have to wait in line so I can't comment but what airline doesn't have lines ups. The flight departed on time and I did not encounter delayed/lost baggage. At the same time my niece was flying HK Express in another city and it went smooth in every aspect.

hk express,Suzanne Walmsley,2019-10-22,✅ Trip Verified |  In June 2019 my husband and I flew from Angkor Wat International Airport to Hong Kong with the carrier Hong Kong Express - Flight UO707. It was supposed to leave at 17.55 but we were nearly 2 hours late departing due to the plane not arriving in time because of bad weather in Hong Kong. When we finally arrived in Hong Kong close to mid night we found that my suitcase on the carousel had been tampered with but as I couldn't think at the time of anything that had been stolen apart from a grey baseball cap I did not report it. I notice that the zip was partly undone and the outer luggage strap was loosely tied on to the handle only. On checking the contents when I got to our hotel I notice that my wallet which was hidden originally at the bottom was now on top and open and the middle compartment also unzipped. As I had taken all my credit cards out previously I only had library cards and shop loyalty cards in it and they had not been touched. Also the coins in the side compartment had not been taken even though that zip was undone too. However a week later on remembering that I had put my wedding rings in the middle zipe of my wallet due to my fingers swelling in the head I immediately contacted the airline but to now avail and I am unsure now how to proceed with no communication forthcoming apart from one that said the CCTV footage revealed nothing. I have informed them that I am aware that 6 baggage handlers were arrested recently for theft but have not received a reply. I am deeply upset at my insurance declined to reimburse me as goods of value should have been with my carry on luggage.,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,1,3,3,,,1,1,no

There are a number of airlines that fly the Hong Kong to Seoul route, but HK Express were the cheapest and had a website that was user friendly. The flight was prompt and efficient. The staff were pleasant and professional. The experience was as good as Cathay Pacific, but without food, drink and entertainment. I really can't fault them. The HK Express staff at Seoul were excellent. I manage to forget that the WiFi egg I hired was in the checked baggage. They helped me by taking the bag out and allow me to retrieve the item.

hk express,H Kan,2019-08-03,✅ Trip Verified |  Kansai to Hong Kong. The flight is just below average. The flight delayed for about 40 minutes as they said that Kansai airport is busy and the weather in HK is bad. They said we can get in the A321 at 1715 but they only open the gate at around 1730. We ordered two boxes of food which one of them is a Thai beef. The food size is a bit smaller than I thought and the taste is bad but it cost a lot of money (HKD65).The flight policy of not allow to use phones during take off and landing is silly.,Family Leisure,Economy Class,4,2,1,2,,2,3,no

hk express,B Quinn,2018-12-07,"✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong to Tokyo. First, when you book on internet, of course the price is attractive and you are directly interested by it. Then, comes the reality : You have to pay for your seat (50 HKD per seat) • You have to pay for the luggage (344 HKD for 25kg) You can pay during the online check-in. However, if you do not pay during the online check-in, the price at the airport counter is the double! My phone had a problem in Japan and I could not made the online check-in. I made a screenshot of the situation (Trying to make it but impossible, with the hour) and I showed it to the counter, to prove that I tried but that there was a problem. They did not care about it and answered : It is not our problem, we can not do anything. Even if they saw that I tried to do it! What is this customer service? Moreover, as it is a low-cost company, their counters are always very far away, and you have to wait long time before to have your flight. Your flight is supposed to be at 8pm? You will take off at 8:30. Then, as the customer service is terrible at the counter, he has to be the same in the plane : Very strange policy about the electronic devices that we can not use during all the take off (and as I told before, it is a long time) and during the landing. First time that it happens to me. To conclude, I paid an extra charge of 590HKD for my luggage to go and to come back so 1180 HKD, plus the seats, I lost many times walking through the airport, waiting at the boarding gates or in the plane. If you do the assessment, at the end, it cost you more money and more time than a good company! Last word : Shame on this company who do not care about customer service and they lost one guest (one more in fact, as I can see on the other reviews that I am not alone in this situation)",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

They were very friendly and helpful about the matter by keeping me updated on where the book might be, and went the extra mile to make sure I had my belongings returned within an hour!

I will not pay another ticket with them because of this, and losing customers like this is very bad in the long term.

I called the center right away and the ticket was said to be canceled with a full reimbursement within 8 weeks from cancellation. After over 8 weeks, I received less than half of the flight reimbursement fee.

hk express,Francis Wong,2018-05-28,"✅ Trip Verified |  HK Express is a low cost airline that has daily flights to various destinations in Japan. I have selected to fly to Osaka with them. To ensure maximum comfort (but still very affordable), I've opted for U-Biz, which includes 30 kg luggage, priority check in lane, luggage handling and boarding. There was discount offered for meals on board too. There was a rather long queue for normal check in, I was so glad that I bought U-Biz, which only took me a few minutes to queue and be checked in. For both the outbound and in bound flights, they were on time, all things promised were delivered. I was seated in the sweet seat which was the front row of 3x3. 4 cabin crew worked hard during the flight, and it was very smooth and uneventful all the way. Food was so-so but still ok.

Macau ferry terminal upstream check-in service was excellent but the flight time change meant serious changes to my morning plan.

When my payment appeared not to have gone through and I received no acknowledgement of my booking, I asked HKE if I should rebook. They told me I should but, after booking again (at a higher cost) I discovered they had already taken the money for the first flight. They accepted that they had failed to confirm the first flight and agreed to refund the money but it took a great many emails and involved a huge amount of time. I even had to battle with them over the insurance I had taken; even though I paid them for it, they tried to claim they couldn't refund it because it was paid on to another company. They also seemed to think it reasonable to refund less than was taken because the exchange rate was different. Any reputable airline would have refunded the higher amount I paid for the second tickets and sent a proper apology for all the anxiety caused and time wasted. There is no complaints procedure. If you ask them via ""chat"" how to complain, they send you the email address of Customer Services about whom I wished to make the complaint. The general impression I got was that they will try as hard as they can to not refund you and will only do so if you are extremely tenacious and decide that it is worth spending the time pursuing them for the principle of the matter.

Finally, we left Kunming at 5pm, arrived in HKG around 10 hours late and had to wait until the following morning for a connecting flight. Staff refused to refund anything, give food or water or pay supplement for hotel.  Point taken; this is last time I will fly HK Express.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,2,2,1,,1,3,no
hk express,S Ramsey,2016-08-23,"✅ Verified Review |  Siem Reap to Incheon via Hong Kong. HK Express did not handle a bad situation well, it was major delays due to a typhoon. I was flying from Siem Reap to Incheon, with a 5 hour layover in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, there was a typhoon in Hong Kong. Everything was delayed, not the the airlines fault. However, their handling of the situation was the worst I could imagine. Passengers were sent an email at 4am to let them know there would be a delay and the flight would leave at 3:40pm, however I did not know until after arriving at the airport. HK Express representatives were not at the airport in the morning and the airport did not know of the delay. We were checked in by other staff. Representatives arrived to the airport and arrived to our gate around noon. They handed out meal vouchers, but didn't discuss the flight with passengers. When I asked to rebook my flight from Hong Kong to Korea, they told me that it was probably already done. The meal the company gave for those of us waiting was incomplete. And with further delays, the flight did not leave until 8:50pm. In Hong Kong I was met by staff off the plane and taken to a place where I could rebook my flight. This was with the help of cabin service staff, who were the redeeming quality of the trip despite having no ability to solve any of the problems. The booking had not been made. I was told that if I wanted a flight before 5:15pm the next day (it was about midnight), I would have to call the company. While waiting on the phone, I was pushed to accept the night flight. Finally, I did so after no one answered the phone. Before booking, the airline staff member left me in the airport. He said two women at the counter would come get me after everything was complete. After three hours I went to the counter as they had not talked to me. They informed me that, although the booking was not complete it was better for me to leave the airport and come back later. I refused without flight confirmation and they called the airline. Apparently the booking had been completed and they were simply unaware. There was no compensation for hotels or meals. The 5:15 flight was delayed until after 8:00pm. These were rolling delays which were continually pushed back. The staff in both Hong Kong and Siem Reap were rude and refused to answer questions. I was repeatedly told to wait and no answer came until I demanded one. Understandably, the airline can do nothing about the major holdups at the airport due to the typhoon, however their policies to deal with these emergencies was poor.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,2,2,1,,1,2,no
hk express,C Long,2016-05-05,"✅ Verified Review |  I had my first trip on this LCC from Hong Kong to Tokyo Narita, and was generally happy with the experience. No online check in so we lined up to check in baggage but that was expected. The flight itself was OK, I had hoped they would dim the lights for longer given there was nothing to do but sleep. The return journey is where the drama occurred, and the airline couldn't have handled it worse. Flight was scheduled to depart at 19.30, there were strong winds at NRT that day, and when I arrived at the counter at around 17.00, they were not checking passengers in and the airport was making announcements that flights were halted due to strong winds. Without going into too much detail, at around 19.00, from flightradar24, I found that the inbound aircraft of my flight landed, only to be kept waiting at the counter, with ground staff telling us due to weather conditions the plane could not land etc. Some time later it was apparent that this aircraft was used for the earlier 16.20 flight. We were only told at after 20.30 that our flight was delayed until 09.30 the next day due to weather. The airline handed out 1000yen cash, sleeping bag, and an offer that if we booked a hotel, the airline would reimburse max USD100. They knew there would be no aircraft for us, yet they kept us waiting. They just kept saying it was weather. All other flights departed that night. The flight eventually was further delayed and took off at after 10.30, without telling us about the additional 1 hour delay. I had a glimpse of hope that in spite of the delay, we might get a free snack or a free drink on board? I was starving. However no, we were told outside food was not allowed and we needed to buy food. Arriving in HKG, ground staff handed out delay certificates but when passengers asked about compensation or anything else, they declared they were simply the agent, they were not HK Express staff. I have not received a single word of feedback.

hk express,Peter Lai,2016-04-10,"✅ Verified Review |  Flight from Hong Kong was delayed from 5 till 9pm, which mean I arrived in Seoul at 12midnight. This meant no trains, so I had to take a expensive taxi to town. No compensation. The return flight was also bit delayed, airline seems lax on punctuality.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2,1,2,,,1,2,no
hk express,Janet Ong,2016-02-06,"I was supposed to take the 6.55am flight from Hong Kong to Seoul. Arrived at the airport at 5.45am, but was told at the check in to leave behind a telephone number and to come back in 5min. 5mins later the lady at the check in told me that the flight was overbooked and that she would need to reschedule me at the 5pm flight. As such I would miss a full day of my trip. Only explanation given was that the plane changed to a smaller one. Compensation was HKD1645, which far from compensates for the time lost.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,1,,,,,1,1,no
hk express,Aeron Aquino ,2016-02-05,"Check in at Tokyo Narita was efficient with HK Express. There was a delay in the flight, hence, we arrived in Hong Kong late. The seating was on a 3-3 configuration. Like any other low cost carrier, it looked and felt cramped, but, the pitch was acceptable. The meals were okay. The cabin crew looked tired but they tried their best to look after us. There were turbulences along the way but nothing major. Overall, HK Express is okay, nothing bad, nothing great.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,5,3,3,2,,3,3,yes
hk express,Francis Wong,2015-11-29,"My experience with HK Express was great. I purchased a very cheap ticket and added hot seat plus hot meal. I was entitled to use their priority check in which was a godsend. Check in took a few minutes with no fuss. Onboard service was on par with any regular airlines. The seating is 3x3 with acceptable seat pitch. No entertainment so bring your own. Food was served immediately after take off. My pre ordered hot meal was delivered with a smile plus a free bottle of water. The quantity is small, but the taste was actually quite good. The pilot was from Australia and the high standard and safety is very reassuring. 2:40 hours passed by quickly and we landed in Chiang Mai perfectly on time.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,8,3,4,4,,4,5,yes
hk express,C Chan,2015-05-27,I took the flight from Hong Kong to Chiang Mai which was supposed to depart at 17.05. However no boarding announcement was made at all and by 17.30 the land crew told us that the flight might depart late and asked us to return by 18.15. Passengers left the queue and returned as told and at approximately 7pm they told us to wait until 19.30. Eventually at 20.30 they told us to wait for another announcement which would tell us whether we could fly or not. There was no offer of water or biscuits or any sort of remedial gestures at all. Finally at 9pm we were told that the flight was ready and we were sent to the plane. We had to wait for another 90 minutes onboard before we could take off. Plane left Hong Kong International Airport at 11pm. Unfortunately that was not the end of the story. The flight attendants sold food and drinks on the plane. As we were all very tired and hungry passengers almost all of us had to buy food from them. My friend and I sat in the middle of the plane and when the trolley passed by us and we just humbly wanted to buy 2 cup noodles the flight attendants said they were out of stock! One point to note is that both the land crew and the cabin crew were very helpful.,,Economy Class,1,3,4,1,1,,1,no
hk express,L Chan,2015-05-18,The HK Express website is easy to use. My flight was from Hong Kong (HKG) to Osaka (KIX). The check-in process with my baggage was pretty straightforward and without problem. The flight was overall quite clean and it departed on time. There is no food/beverage/water everything needs to be bought if you want to eat/drink. But that's okay if it's a short flight. The returning flight was just as simple and easy. There was staff at KIX to help with the check-in and baggage. Flight was also on time overall a smooth and problem free process. The baggage came out pretty quickly on both my flights not too long of a wait. I would definitely recommend this airline for flights around Asia.,,Economy Class,9,4,4,1,1,,5,yes
hk express,M Galjor,2015-02-20,"I've done the HKG-HND round-trip on HK Express four times in the last 3 months. I always take UO622 dep HKG 7.10 to go to Japan and UO623 dep HND 1.10am coming back. I used to fly CX to HND but prices have really gone up over the past year. Overall I'd give 3 out of 5 stars for my experience. Prices are of course much cheaper than CX and I appreciate that. 2) Flight attendants are professional courteous and the service is good (not that there are many opportunities to get ""served"" since HKE doesn't offer complementary beverage/food service nor does it offer inflight entertainment). 3) The HKG-HND-HKG flights I've taken have always been on time. 4) Flight times are much more convenient than the CX flights. However 1) Seats are uncomfortable - it's an LCC after all! This doesn't really bother me for the inbound flight which is 3.5 hours but I do end up feeling exhausted after the outbound which is a 4.5 hour redeye. I find the ""sweet seats"" located in the exit aisles a really bad deal - you get the (slightly) extra leg room but your seat has zero recline. 2) Baggage fees: I've noticed that more recently they've started to enforce their baggage rules much more strictly. Hand baggage may not be more than 7.7kg. If you don't sign up for checked in baggage in advance (online when you buy your ticket) you will be charged an arm and a leg at the airport. This happened to me during my last trip and wouldn't have bothered me (rules are rules after all and these fees are part of the LCC business model) had it not taken 1 hour to receive my bags at Hong Kong airport. 3) Long wait for baggage - This last point is apparently an every day occurrence with HKE at least at Hong Kong airport. They are working with a small staff and small planes so your bags will routinely take an hour or so to arrive at Hong Kong airport baggage claim. This is needless to say frustrating though not the biggest deal in the case of UO623 since you have to kill an hour or so after the flight lands anyway (the first Airport Express to Hong Kong station doesn't leave until 5.54am and UO623 lands at around 4.40am). 4) No mileage programme. All in all I will still use Hong Kong Express but due to some of the negative points I listed above only if the price differential between CX and UO is significant enough to be worth it.",,Economy Class,7,,,,,,3,yes
hk express,Alexander Capousis,2015-02-06,3 flights in the last month (ICN-HKG HKG-CNX HKG-PUS). All arrived either on-time or early. Contract check-in staff at all airports but check in was quick and efficient. Staff were friendly and helpful. You'll likely be on a shuttle bus at some point if you're flying them at HKG. Would love it if they added a check-in lane for those without checked baggage. Expensive food and drink options on board so eat before you go. Pilots were informative and professional. Highly recommended for those on a budget!,,Economy Class,8,,,,,,5,yes
hk express,David Silverking,2014-08-14,"We recently flew HKG to Penang direct. The flight was on time leaving and was faultless on the 4 hr flight. The seats are fixed up right with no recline option on any seats. We bought the extra legroom option & were glad we did. Considering the tickets were half the same Dragon air flight and landed only 10 minutes apart this is a no brainer. ""I'll be back"".",,Economy Class,9,3,4,3,1,,5,yes
