singapore airlines,Bagus Ferriyanto,2020-06-11,"✅ Trip Verified |  Osaka Kansai to Singapore. There weren't many people on the flight, the check was smooth, no queue. As well as you can tell on how many people were waiting in the boarding room. Funny story the airline website indicate the plane were full where you can't select another economy seats, and pushes you choose at the end of the tail close to lavatory. Even when you're boarded the plane when clearly no people, they weren't let you sit on the same economy coach that were empty. I have to asked 3 times to asked them to move my seat (where less than 50 people on that flight) in such a big plane, which eventually they did it. Nonetheless I still enjoyed this midnight flight and had the whole row for myself.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,9,5,4,5,5,5,5,yes

Although the current situation due to global pandemic got me bit worried to kept flying for this holiday. Since it wasn't a cancelled flight/ route, I decided to carry on. The flight for DPS-SIN were rather full and I enjoyed their Boeing 787. It was a short flight and dinner were served during the flight was delightful. We had a quick layover in Singapore for my connecting flight to Tokyo with A380. I sat on lower deck and the plane was merely full. They gave us light meal before turndown service, however a mistake was made by the cabin crew as they gave me a wrong food that am allergic too (I've never requested). I got sick during the flight. They kept apologise to me and one of the senior crew came to approach. They offered me a doctor service upon arrival in Narita which I refused. I got slightly better, but it shouldn't be happen. Despite of the allergic reaction due to their service, overall I was still able to enjoy the trip. It was just hindering me to give them a perfect score.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,8,5,4,4,5,5,5,yes

The service from the crew was top-quality, and the toilet was jam-packed with amenities which I really liked.

I was checked in but later that day read on the Singapore website that you weren't allowed to enter Singapore airport if you've been to Germany in the last 14 days. I did. I went through Germany for wintersport to Austria just beforey, so I cancelled my flight. I received 83 euros back (which hardly covers my flight) and I didn't have a choice of accepting that money or not. I just got it back. I tried to contact the airline many times about the situation and never got a reply. Now they're saying they can't help me because I already received 83 euro back for my cancellation.

singapore airlines,David Pickles,2020-04-02,"Not Verified |  Due to the corona virus out break we decided to travel home 6 days early out of a 28 day holiday in Penang, we contacted SIA regarding a change to our flight who informed us we would have to pay 1350RM per person a total of 2700RM. After booking the flight we received an email saying the flight was cancelled with no explanation other than to ring one of there offices in Penang or KL this was at 18.15 there offices close at 17.30. I feel that Singapore Airlines are taking advantage of passengers trying to return home how can they justify charging customers for wanting to return home early. My opinion is 2700RM was an exorbitant price to have pay for a change to flights tickets also the both flights had spare seats when we boarded the flights.

singapore airlines,B Thomas,2020-03-29,"✅ Trip Verified | My flight was canceled by Singapore Airlines due to Corona Virus. No transit in SIN possible anymore. They simply cancelled my flights and gave no helping hand to re-book etc. I am booked in Business Class. No refund was granted, only to keep the ticket open for one year. They informed me that if I re-booked to a later flight, a fare difference might appear and I would have to pay on top. This is unbelievable. First they deny any refund, which all other airlines grant, now I also have to pay on top if I re-book to another date. As a frequent traveler and Gold Card Member of Star Alliance, I never expected such behavior from SQ. I strongly suggest not to tolerate such a customer unfriendly style. For me and my company, SQ is not anymore in the traveling list. We will prefer LH/TG going to Europe, and to the US. I am very sorry to write these lines, but other fellow travelers should be aware.

singapore airlines,Larry Reed,2020-03-26,"✅ Trip Verified | Melbourne to Singapore. This was our first time flying Premium Economy and my expectation was for Singapore Airlines was to provide an exceptional experience. Firstly the boarding in Melbourne was good, the ground and cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Plenty of legroom and nice comfortable seats. Noise-cancelling headphones were supplied although my wife had to ask for them as they weren't at her seat. The back of the seat in front was a bit grubby and I used an antiseptic wipe to clean it, there were some other grubby bits around the armrest and tray table. Champagne was offered and gratefully accepted. The meal service was prompt although it was just an economy meal. I was hoping for something a little better as I paid double the economy ticket price. Wine was offered however only one red and one white, I don't like Sauvignon Blanc and that was the only white. I did ask the flight attendant for a Chardonnay and she was very obliging and managed to find a glass for me. Big Plus! The flight was comfortable and the crew were outstanding. It makes a difference when the crew are customer-focused. Overall a good experience. Two things, ditch the Sauvignon Blanc and provide an upgraded Premium Economy meal.",Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,9,5,5,2,5,4,3,yes

Once I got through to it, the call centre's staff were efficient in getting me suitable flights. Check-in at Haneda was friendly and quick. The ANA lounge was comfortable with a great view of the runway, although food and drink options were limited due to antivirus precautions. The Singapore lounge was very spacious with a good variety of food and drink choices. Onboard both flights the seats were very comfortable and the service was impeccable. My Chinese-style vegetarian meal on the first leg was very tasty, but the Indian-style vegetarian meal on the second leg was not as impressive, with little curry and a lot of bread.

singapore airlines,D Kardit,2020-02-28,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ahmedabad to San Francisco via Singapore. The overall in-cabin experience was fine, however, the check-in experience at the Ahmedabad airport was horrible. The staff gave me a hard time with baggage. It took 2 hours and standing in the check-in line three times to get my boarding passes. They weighed the personal bag and made fuss about the weight being 0.2 kgs over in one bag while it was 0.3 kgs under in another bag. I was told that the personal bag, which happened to be my laptop bag, cannot have anything else but the laptop and laptop accessories. I asked them if there was a scale I can use to distribute/adjust the weight across all my luggage pieces and they did not know or were not bothered to find out. Each time I had to go through bag screening and stand in long lines to find out that I still need to balance out 0.1 or 0.2 kgs of weight between my bags.  While I was going through this ordeal, the staff is trying to sell me upgrade to business class in spite of telling him no once. I do have to mention that I flew Singapore airlines from SFO to Ahmedabad on Jan 27th 2020 and did not have a similar experience with luggage at the San Francisco airport. Given the coronavirus outbreak, I wish the in-cabin staff had some masks on hand to distribute to passengers requesting it.

singapore airlines,K Borgsen,2020-02-27,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Zurich. A few weeks in advance they changed several of my upcoming itineraries out of the blue with no offer of refund or compensation. One of the changed itineraries is a big change and really messed up my travel plans. First of all, I paid for a specific itinerary and they just decide to change it to an inferior itinerary. Secondly, I have a non-refundable domestic flight (not SIA) that I can no longer use with the new itinerary so I have to buy a new USD 100 ticket. So, I am USD 100 out of pocket. Customer service is non-existing with SIA. 3 weeks ago my domestic flight (not SIA) got re-scheduled and I arrived very early at MNL so I went to the SIA counter and asked if they could put me on the 2 hour earlier flight to Changi. My flight from Changi to Europe would be the same. So, I would have a 5 hour lay-over in Changi instead of 3 hours. SIA replied that they could do that but asked me to pay a change fee. I declined and took my original flight. I might think it is poor customer service but I acknowledge that they were in their full right to want to charge a change fee although it is in both our interest to increase my buffer time to reduce the risk of missing my connection. However, now that they changed my next itineraries I don't hear them talking about them paying a change fee to me. It is not OK to change and provide an inferior itinerary for the same price for any customer. ",Business,Economy Class,1,1,3,,,1,1,no

Check in and boarding was, as is usual quick and efficient, with a friendly welcome from the crew. There are no pre-flight drinks offered in premium economy. Drinks are offered after take off, including French Champagne, but in tiny plastic tumblers. We had utilized “book the cook”, which had a large range of options, but these are served in an economy format, which nullifies any special qualities. There are no dedicated crew in premium economy, with the result that is approximately an hour before trays are removed and drink refills are available. The flight was good, the entertainment system excellent. The crew came round often with water and fruit juice, and a second meal was served before arrival.

singapore airlines,N Ganakaya,2020-02-23,"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Colombo via Singapore business class. Left on Jan 27 2020 from LAX and returned Feb 21 2020. At their website we were told one can pre-book meals called 'book the cook' which was a joke, no none of the cabin crew knew anything about it. We were given a very generic meal which was nothing to rave about. I complained to the crew and they promised I would have my choice on the return flight - that did not happen either. Their website also bragged about free wifi at cruising altitude, I was able to connect for 10 mins ,after which there was no way to connect for free. Same thing happened when I logged -in under my wife's name - the cabin crew was helpless and could not help. I was told to pay to get wifi , which of-course I did not. The cabin crew were fantastic and did their best to make us feel happy but there was only so much they could do. I travelled frequently on Singapore airline about 10 yrs ago and then I switched to another airline through Hong Kong , regrettably I could not book with them due to the Corona scare in China. My seat on the A350 could not be reclined 180 degrees and my feet hit the front seat and I had to curve my body to fit the space. There was a bed of course -the flight attendant had to lower the vertical back section and fold it down to make a bed, but the hardness and the need to curve the spine made it hard to sleep on this 18 hrs from LAX and 15hrs to LAX.

Our experience was worse than any bucket-shop airlines and we thought Singapore was a world standard airline. On the Siem Reap to Singapore Route my seat had a broken table which I was informed only on the way to the boarding the flight when I was suddenly being pressurised by their ground staff. Although I was waiting at the airport near the gate for over an hour none of your ground staff bothered to discuss this matter with me.  Furthermore the table was only secured with sticky tape which kept falling on my lap and on a couple of occasions fell on my watch! We then received further shoddy service from ground staff at Singapore on the Kolkata flight. Having paid USD 700+ for our one-way ticket from REP to CCU I was shocked to be downgraded to an airline with filthy seats, no TV, no leg space and in general badly in need of an uplift.

The seats on the 777 are more comfortable than those on the (refitted) A380. A pity because seat comfort is a priority on a thirteen and a half hour flight. To be honest, the old A380 seats were more comfortable than the new but the new look better. Wonderful attentive service from the FAs on both flights. The food served was good on both flights, in fact the ""supper"" (chicken thigh, mashed potato and steamed veg with gravy) on the A380 was exceptionally good for economy class. Sadly the breakfasts remain poor. They continue to serve these awful chicken sausages instead of a decent pork sausage (the ONLY thing BA does better than SQ) and the eggs are failures; either a rubbery omelette or scrambled egg that is sloppy and lacks flavour. I did notice some cost saving measures that I had not previously seen on SQ. No amenity kits, which I did not miss but no longer serving sachets of salt and pepper with the meals is a mistake. Airline meals generally lack flavour so I did miss the black pepper. There was also a smaller selection of snacks in the galley. In my view, they still beat the competition, mainly down to their superior customer service so I will continue to use them.

Very friendly and efficient ground service. Cabin crew is the among the nicest. Always up for your request. Food quality has gone down as compared to the past. However, drink game is up from offering cocktails and liquor for economy class. I thought I would enjoy the A350-900 more but turned out I like the Boeing 787-10 better.

I had looked forward to where I could go with the new Airbus 350 and Singapore Airlines with their excellent quality reputation. However, the entertainment consisted of very few new movies. A menu card was handed out, I ordered chicken with Thai curry. The meat was full of cartilage and the rice was dried up. This was accompanied by a cold soft sugar tasting roll.  Singapore Airline offer maybe the cheapest red wine I have tasted. Fortunately they offered Tiger beer. Although the crew carried sparkling wine on the wagon, you had not right to this since ""it was not in the menu card"" I was told. Very strange.

The meal was okay, i had this fried noodle with beef served with bun and some fruits. There were always lot of different beverage options on Singapore Airlines which is actually great. It was a short route to Singapore and i did really enjoy the flight. Singapore to Seoul Boeing 787-10. B787-10 legroom was a bit shorter but still enough for 180 cm man like me. But the arm rest gap was a bit narrow. The configuration was 3x3x3 and i sat on the middle and two other passengers sat on my right and left side. It was quite okay at the first place, then the meal time came up. I struggled not to spill other's passengers meal with my elbow because it was narrow. The entertainment system was really new. It had a lot of different options there and it was up to date. It was 5 hours 25 minutes flight. We just had one time meal and one snack time. It was okay tho. There were 2 options such as Korean or Western menus. I opted Korean one with the menu of Bibimbap. It was just okay since bibimbap was only vegetable and beef mixed with Korean condiments and.

singapore airlines,Teng Yong Khoo,2020-02-04,"✅ Trip Verified |  Busan to Singapore. First of all, the service has dramatically improved since my last trip with SIA. Cabin crews are super friendly, cheerful and serves customer with a big smile. However, the most disappointing part is the attitude of the ground staff in Busan. One of the ground staff was very impatient and does things insincerely. She delays the precious time of my travelmate by asking unnecessary documents as other ground staff does not require it. Another shocking part is the cleanliness situation of the cabin which was quite dirty and not up to SIA's standard. There were coffee stains on the tray table and the cupholder of the seat. However, the cabin crew was responsive and quickly cleaned the stain for lunch. Food was OK and when I did not finish my food, the cabin crew did asked for feedback and offered me other options which is something I appreciate.

singapore airlines,D Haloud,2020-01-20,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Singapore was the biggest let down. Okay food but they ran out of certain dishes during the first service run. Service on this flight was understandably rushed due to its 2-hours duration. But it was also terrible. I ordered post-meal drink and notes were taken but they forgot about me. I requested the drink again, but was told too late the bar is closed. We pay premium for business class partly to enjoy the amenities including F&B. Running out of certain dishes and forgetting to serve a drink renders this as a wasted expense and for that we currently do not recommend this airline.

The IFE is one of the better ones on the market, with a decent touchscreen and good selection of movies and TV shows.

Then I asked for Chinese tea (instead of what they were taking around) - and was told ‘we don’t have any’. At SFO check-in counter, I stood at the head of the Premium Economy line for 15min as passengers who had come after me were attended to before me. After 3 such times, when I expressed surprise, a lady said I was in the wrong queue for bag drop. I pointed out to her I was not standing for bag drop but check in, after which I was attended to.

The older A380 was operating this 14-hour flight from Singapore to London but I still enjoyed the seat. My cabin was nearly empty and we could choose whatever seat we wanted. The seat was huge - it had a lot of legroom, width and was very comfortable. Unfortunately, the IFE was not touchscreen and it was not very responsive, which would be expected for a 13-year-old system. There were still a large variety of movies and TV shows in the entertainment system. The crew were friendly, helpful and provided excellent service, they really made the flight enjoyable.

Love the ""Book the Cook"" service where you can order fine dining meals in advance. Great choice of wines and plenty of champagne refills! My wife can only eat gluten free meals and a small criticism is the lack of gluten free options, WiFi allowance of only 100 Mb in Business Class is rather limited as well. Very smooth transfer in Singapore and Kris Lounge not too crowded. The Turkish Airlines lounge used by SQ at Istanbul Airport is massive and offers an excellent choice of hot Turkish food.

When we are about to land, a passenger went into toilet, the Male Flight attendant asked him before he went in “can you hold ?” The passenger shook his head &’went in, subsequently the flight attendant talk to us (all the passengers), this kind of people caused landing to delay. After a while the flight attendant went on to knock on the toilet door & shouted to ask the passenger to come out quickly. Moscow - Singapore 2 Jan 2020. The  question is that does SIA inform their passengers how much alcohol they can consume ? I heard a female flight attendant said “he has drank a lot” in Mandarin to another flight attendant. Later the customers in front of me request for drinks & I heard the flight attendant said “this is a plane not a bar”, this is very rude to a customer even you mean well to control consumption of alcohol. SIA has to make a decision, either no alcohol, limited alcohol (informed passengers before booking of tickets) or free flow, find a way to handle it instead of being rude to  passengers.

singapore airlines,F Darlen,2020-01-03,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Newark. My wife and I were seated in 31A/31C on SQ22. There was a family of five that was too overbearing and inconsiderate (non stop talking from SIN to EWR) during the entire flight. This made it very difficult to sleep even on premium economy. Paying extra $120 each for these seats was a waste of money. The food (including ""Book the Cook"") was not extraordinary. The entertainment selection (movies, music, TV series) was inadequate. I understand that the flight crew needed rest during this long journey. However, not cleaning the toilet bin was unacceptable. I've flown other competitors on Premium Economy (ANA, EVA) and I can attest that the toilets for Premium Economy were kept immaculate during the long legs to either Japan or Taipei. There is something to be said about the passenger treatment when they are not flying Business Class. On a separate flight from MNL to SIN, my wife and I flew SQ on business.

singapore airlines,D Bolt,2020-01-01,"✅ Trip Verified |  Auckland to Singapore. Decided to try premium economy due to extra legroom and slightly wider seats although the additional recline is negligible. These two options were provided but the seat itself was uncomfortable and the much vaunted leg and foot rests are not fit for purpose if you are of average or above average height. I used the facility of “Book the Cook” for two of the four meals provided (return flight) but sadly the meals were unappetising, bland and why is the airline no longer providing salt and pepper? There was only one round of drinks offered so although premium economy is quite a bit more expensive than economy the benefits are small except for the leg space. Also had to use economy toilets which would have been fine except that they were not particularly well maintained but I do admit that both flights were full up so staff would have been kept busy.

Boarding was slightly delayed but well managed with priority given to those traveling with children. New A350 which on the regional is still 3x3x3 but a little less space between the seats and no premium economy, actually prefer the cabin colours to the long haul version. Staff were very friendly with the service being first rate and a good selection of meals options. Very pleasant 4.5 hour flight. Flight arrived on-time but due to a medical emergency everyone had to remain seated until the person could be deplaned. This took about 30 min which then meant that due to 2 other flights having landed immigration was chaos,(not SQ fault).

With the 787s, the space between the seat and the TV monitor is quite narrow and when the table is out, one must sit quite upright. It is not as comfortable as the Airbus or Qatar’s q-suites but definitely way better than 99% of other airlines. I had the lobster thermidor and was happy that this is much better now - tender yet creamy sauce. There are Asian drinks on board, such as umeshu, which is brilliant.

singapore airlines,C Hoffmann,2019-12-27,"✅ Trip Verified |  Perth to Singapore in July 2019. Mid-night flight fmainly to see how the 787 compares with the A350. Check-in was smooth save for the issue with them not allowing us to take the travel stroller, which folds into something the size of a briefcase on board as it wasn't in a carry bag? Random thing is 2 previous legs and several other flights with SQ this wasn't an issue but we were told it was a new rule. Odd thing cabin crew never heard of it and 3 days later from SIN-MUC there were no issues with it being taken as hand luggage. Flight boarded late due to a late arrival but some of the time was made up with a near on time arrival. The 787 has a tighter configuration than the A350 regional configuration. This means less seat width and what I perceived as a little less leg room. Plane was spotless. Given the choice I would take the A350 over the 787 as it has it beat in all areas. Crew were more or less going through the motions and a bit robotic. Entertainment options still top, not even with 4 legs flow in the same month did you run out of things to watch. Breakfast served was good with all options available. Of the 4 legs this was probably the most disappointing from SQ, but still an enjoyable flight.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,7,3,3,4,5,3,4,yes

Until now I have been very happy with SQ and have always preferred it above Cathay Pacific (hence the extra 4 hours in taking these flights instead of the direct flights) The flight was great and nothing to complain .. as a cardholder I had access to the lounge and SQ has been always great in accepting my kids (younger then 12yrs) with me in their lounges. Upon arrival in Hong Kong I discovered that one of my suitcases was damaged (zipper was damaged and could not be used anymore)/I went straight to their handling agent and was offered 3 options: 1) they could provide me with a report for my travel insurance, 2) They could try to fix it or 3) I was offered 500 HKD (50 Euro) as compensation. I argued with them that they destroyed the luggage so why should my insurance pay for their damaged caused, also the 500HKD would never cover a new suitcase (bought a year ago) so I asked to see somebody from Singapore airlines .. a girl appeared and immediately the same offer was made but the amount got up to 800HKD .. I argued that the money wouldn't even cover a new one. So she agreed to have my luggage picked up from my place in Hkg and tried to have it repaired. Nothing happened for 3 days and I was forced to contact the airline direct. Anyway suitcase was picked up on Thursday and was told on Saturday afternoon that they couldn't fix it and would offer me 1080HKD (no idea how they came to that amount) and it was a take it or leave it deal.

Our main issues with the delays with boarding, departure and arrivals. We have almost missed connecting flights on 2 occasions. The second one was the trip from Sydney to Singapore. We had a very stressful time changing terminals and walking several hundred metres to the gate when the boarding of the second flight was scheduled to start while we were still on board the 1st flight. I had had recent surgery and literally ran to the gate with my hand luggage. Ground staff are less than helpful as well - boarding using boarding groups is ridiculous- so much confusion and people trying to pass people putting luggage away. Why not call boarding by last few rows at a time rather than a huge boarding group. Staff on the ground disorganised - twice Singapore airlines has lost our luggage and we were left on holidays for a couple of days with no clothes, till we have managed to get our luggage - food was tasteless, surely no one likes the cheese and mushroom mini pies on the Colombo-Singapore leg.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,3,2,4,1,2,2,3,no

singapore airlines,Ken Howie,2019-12-12,"Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Singapore in premium economy on the late flight. The incoming flight was delayed as the preceding flight was late departing the gate, and only arrived at the time boarding was supposed to start. However following a very quick turnaround and very efficiently organised boarding, the flight departed on time. There was the usual warm welcome from the crew, who were very active helping passengers stow belongings and settle in. Singapore Airlines do not offer pre-departure drinks, unlike most airlines in premium economy. The seat is comfortable, with good legroom and recline. The calf rest serves little purpose, and is difficult to retract when deployed, which is usually by accident. It was noted that very few passengers used the calf rest. The cabin overall is very pleasant. Service commenced promptly after take off. There was no separate drinks run, which is understandable with a late departure. The meal can best be described as typical airline food, the best part being the ice cream. Service and food is strictly economy class, no crockery nor tablecloth, and from Johannesburg no opportunity to book the cook. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers, with a somewhat meagre offering. A good champagne is offered in premium economy, but in a plastic faux stemmed glass that is even smaller than the standard tumbler. No refills are offered until the trays are cleared somewhat later. Both my wife and I were able to sleep for several hours, and it seemed quite strange to be woken up from a deep sleep to be offered lunch. This was about two hours before landing, which was ahead of schedule. De-planing was quick, and immigration and luggage collection super efficient, as is the norm at Changi. Overall this was a good flight, with excellent service measured against the standard of economy. Unfortunately it is economy class service, and through no fault of the crew lacks the extras expected in premium economy.

I am not saying my previous SQ flight was bad or awful, it was great but I did feel like they could have improved more. But, my recent flight with SQ was near flawless! It seemed like they had listened to customer’s feedback and made the overall experience better. The most obvious improvement was the IFE system. They employed the newest technology regarding the IFE system, the screen was wide and really responsive to touch. The colors were bright, there were some of the newest released movies available and the available media content (music, video, movies) were more than enough to accompany your whole journey. I didn’t even open my ipad throughout my trip. The seats were redesigned, I felt more comfortable and the leg space was spacious. The food and beverage was even more tastier and ever. At the moment, for me, it is the best airline! It’s not perfect though, I want SQ to outdo themselves and become better overtime. If I could give one suggestion, I would like them to provide wireless connection for the headphones because their in house earphones don’t cut it and most of todays head/earphones are wireless.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,9,5,4,5,5,4,5,yes
singapore airlines,Andre Moreitz,2019-12-09,"✅ Trip Verified | We always look forward to flying SQ because the crews are so well-trained and the flight plan/timetable suits us. Leg from Sydney to Singapore the plane left on time, but what a disappointment the boarding process is, compared to Changi. The Boarding by Group No is a neat idea and works well at Changi, but Sydney is just the usual fare of Economy passengers standing in a massive queue trying to get on as quickly as possible and staff announcing the boarding by group, but not enforcing it. And the overhead screens showed Group 4 non-stop whilst they boarded other groups, whatever. Service on board was warm and welcoming, food was good but, surprisingly, even though it was announced, no immigration cards were handed out. When I asked, I was told they didn’t have any. I think they just ran out of time. Love flying on the A380, spacious, calm and quiet, it’s a great experience. Got into Changi a few minutes early. Next day afternoon take off for FRA on 777. Food was sparse and mediocre but not bad. Just not quite the same standard and amounts as last year. The entertainment system has a big screen but the amount on offer is nowhere near Emirates standard and it is harder to find things/operate and the touchscreen is sometimes not as responsive as one would have liked. Crew again, very good and friendly. Lots of snacks available incl very fresh apples during meal times, the wines from Chile were excellent and the crew was always walking around with drink trays. A disappointing cost cutting measure on both flights was that they don’t hand out amenity kits anymore, unless you ask cabin crew for them.

singapore airlines,J Horace Pacis,2019-12-03,"Not Verified |  Flew JFK-FRA-SIN vv on SQ25/26 on Premium Economy. Great value overall with airfare at $1000 RT. JFK facilities are subpar in T4 for premium airline - boarding was chaotic with roughly six separate lines outside main gate to handle the double decker flight. Prem Economy cabin was nice and clean, nice orange/grey color scheme. Blanket and pillow on seat, along with with noise cancelling headphones. Amenity kit upon request containing socks, dental kit. Eyemask upon request. Nice pitch, calf support and generous recline for Economy. Meals were on the smaller side, only difference with the back I believe is an extra choice and champagne on plastic cups. Was able to prebook meal using Book the Cook which is a nice feature for Premium Economy. JFK-FRA cabin crew much friendlier than FRA-SIN, but still the trademark SQ service throughout. Krisworld has a great selection of movies and TV- the add playlist is pretty nifty and easy to use. Transfer at FRA was 90min, no fuss, no security. Arrival in SQ was easy and quick. Check in on return flight was great, T3 of Changi is very nice. Return flight was non-eventful. Excellent service particularly on FRA-JFK sector (less full) whereas out of SIN was packed. Great experience overall. Would definitely recommend the PremEcon if you keep the fare to less than $1200.

The armchair was very comfortable with thick padding, and the bed was easily the most comfortable I have experienced on a plane. The suite itself was so spacious that I thought I was sleeping in a small hotel room. Meal service was great with a lot of attention to details, though I did not find the food as tasty as on other top first class services, including SQ own old Suites. I probably chose the wrong menu item then (book-the-cook was not available for Shanghai).

Furthermore, the IFE was responsive and there was a very large variety of movies available. A lunch menu was given to all passengers, which is a great touch to an already good service. Lunch was served on my flight and it was a delicious pork and chicken combination. The crew provided excellent service and promptly provided me with drinks whenever I requested for them.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,10,5,5,5,5,5,5,yes
singapore airlines,Elaine Loh,2019-12-02,"✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. I had a nice surprise when I discovered I was boarding an SQ plane rather than a SilkAir one. Service is good like any other SQ flight. The plane was old but whatever, it was only 45 minutes. We had access to the Entertainment but had no earphones, so unable to watch movies properly. There is 1 drink service. Coffee, tea or juice. I am looking forward to SIA decommissioning all SilkAir planes. The service and seats of SQ are way better.",Business,Economy Class,9,4,5,3,3,5,5,yes
singapore airlines,Elaine Loh,2019-12-01,"✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Singapore. A fantastic flight with great food. The drinks selection was extensive. I had Umeshu but was disappointed there was no sake. The satay and Pate appetizers welcomed me to Singapore before I arrived in SG. The service is impeccable, and we are known by our names. Will definitely fly Singapore Airlines again.",Business,Business Class,9,5,5,5,5,5,4,yes
singapore airlines,E Shafer,2019-11-30,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Singapore. A mechanical problem with the plane after shifting our gate to a half hour walk away from the original. They go into total chaos, total ineptness. No other plane available. They do not shift passengers onto their other flight, another plane, or other airlines. Four hours later, they send a new plane from Singapore. So six hours delay. The hand writing up of food vouchers for the layover was also quite humorous for 200 passengers. Very poor communication at all times, not even answering direct simple questions.  With the checkin process, more than 12 hours living in the airport. ",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,1,,,,,1,1,no

An amazing experience for us as first time passengers with Singapore Airlines The staff is very friendly and professional, dressed and groomed very well.

The entertainment for long flights was top quality and a huge variety is available Right from boarding, wet hot cloths provides to stepping off the plane was a 10/10 experience.

singapore airlines,M Singh,2019-11-27,"✅ Trip Verified | I have flown SQ a few times before, but find that the current A350 economy class seats are very uncomfortable, at least for a 6' person like me. BLR-SIN was a short haul flight which was even more tightly packed, SIN-MEL was marginally better. MEL-SIN was an older B777, which was far better than the new gen 350s in terms of economy class seats. I had booked SFML, but in every flight ended up getting a piece of tasteless, overcooked fish just dabbed with some tomato sauce - a big difference from my previous experience with seafood meal a few years ago. I do not think I will go for this option any more on Singapore Airlines. The flights were on time, the crew helpful, but overall my experience was far from being positive.",Business,Economy Class,5,1,4,1,4,4,3,no
singapore airlines,A Wong,2019-11-26,"✅ Trip Verified |  Milan to Singapore. Singapore Airlines generally runs a tight ship. Service is quick, friendly and precise and they may be the only airline I’ve flown with that offers hot towels to economy passengers (though it’s pretty standard for premium economy). The premium economy seats are well equipped with large seatback displays, large windows, and comfy leather seats, and the food is decent. Nice of them to have a legrest and footrest on the seats and I’m pleased to say most flights were quite punctual. Check in was quick and easy, and planing/deplaning was efficient. Cabin crew exercised caution when assisting guests with stowing luggage in the overhead bins, and they periodically passed by with refreshments",Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,10,5,5,5,5,5,4,yes
singapore airlines,S Peal,2019-11-24,"✅ Trip Verified |  I usually fly Qantas but chose to fly Singapore Airlines this time, I flew Premium economy. Would I fly again, probably not. My first flight resulted in my seat not functioning and the seats were incredibly uncomfortable compared to Scoot (adjoining flight).

singapore airlines,Prateek Shukla,2019-11-22,"✅ Trip Verified | Bengaluru to Brisbane via Singapore. I have been travelling with Singapore Airlines for several years now. I have never had a bad experience ever. The last time we flew, however, was quite disappointing. I observed 2 things - 1) we always order Indian meals and have been satisfied always, but and the quality of the meals this time was quite bad. The first meal was a tasteless serve and the second one was of 3 Quiches (since when are quiches Indian meals?). And they were bad anyway. Furthermore, on the return trip, my wife received 3 oily and smelly Samosas. Who serves 3 samosas in one sitting? What is the chef thinking? 2) the staff while polite was not involved as they usually are. In my experience, Singapore Airlines makes a very conscious attempt to connect with travellers. They aim to make you as comfortable as possible, however, this time there was a non-commital attitude which was very unlike them. I had to ask for water more times then I can remember. Earlier it was always served in intervals because they were prompt. No feedback form was shared too. My child always receives some small talk with the staff and a little gift. This time there was no attention and no gift either.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,6,4,1,1,5,5,3,yes
singapore airlines,Stephen Mason ,2019-11-20,"Not Verified |  I have to admit to a huge disappointment on flying economy class with this airline. The outward trip on the A380 was extremely comfortable, flight attendants good but food was awful, something I wasn’t expecting having read about the excellent quality of their meals. My main grumble was the return flight on a 777, I have to say that the seat pitches couldn’t possibly have been the 32” advertised on Skytrax. I am 6ft tall and my knees were touching the seat in front and reclining made little difference as the person in front was fully reclined. I can fully understand how a sardine must feel! The food on this flight was awful, totally lacking in taste. Now I know that some people reading this review will say that if I want more room then fly premium economy or business class, something I would love to do if it was affordable! All in all, flight attendants were wonderful, food was awful and the 777 was diabolical. Sorry Singapore Airlines I won’t be flying with you again other than on a A380.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,6,2,5,1,4,5,4,no
singapore airlines,N Paluno,2019-11-17,✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Dubai. I was disappointed with the option of foods during flights. We were asked by the FA to choose between chicken sandwich and Hamus with flat bread so I chose the chicken sandwich since I am not a fan of Hamus but it wasn’t available anymore so the FA insisted if I could have the Hamus instead. I just had a cup of coffee. And also I have also asked for water twice during that flight but nothing was given to me. It made me think that they gave only minimal attention to economy passengers. ,Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,4,2,2,4,4,3,no
singapore airlines,Ethan Phua,2019-11-17,"✅ Trip Verified | Singapore Airlines maintained its excellent standard on this 5-hour flight. A pillow and blanket were available on the seat when we boarded. The cabin was clean and despite the flight being nearly full, it was still a very good experience. Furthermore, the legroom of the seat was excellent and the seat was very comfortable. The tray table was wide and sturdy, and there was sufficient storage with a nice pocket for my phone and nice pouches for me to put things in. There was a wide selection of movies available as well. The cabin crew were as usual, excellent and provided great service. A meal service was provided for this red-eye flight, and my Chicken meal was good. Despite being delayed on departure, we arrived in Shanghai on time. SIA’s newest product on the 787 is indeed very well designed and the flight was very good overall.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,10,5,5,5,5,5,4,yes
singapore airlines,C Hee,2019-11-16,"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Singapore. First I flew in SQ and experience the lounges in both Sydney and Melbourne this month. I must say it's the worst experience I have ever had. Running out of food, decor bland and functional (barely) at best, staff sombre and angry. It is tragic for SQ to sell itself as a premium airline with such tired conditions. All in all disappointing experience on SQ",Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,5,3,3,2,3,2,2,no

Frankfurt to  New York. My experience on this flight was good overall. Check-in, boarding processes were well organized. Food tasted better than business class offerings on some other airlines.

singapore airlines,Basil Ben,2019-11-13,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Trivandrum via Singapore. I booked this flight under SIA and was not expecting they would code share a full service fare ticket with low cost carrier Scoot on SIN -TRV sector. SIA is charging the same amount in fare as compared to previous years while they code shared with Silk Air which is a full service airline. There was no option for basic seat selection and was served instant fried rice topped with meat and peas. They served a bottle of water and no option for tea/coffee or soft drinks. Silk Air served beer and spirits . I understand why SIA is resorting to this sort of behaviour at the expense of passenger comfort, profits and making use of the monopoly they enjoy on this route. Shameful for an airline which advertises itself as ""Great Way to Fly"". SIA should make amends to passengers who were made to fly on Scoot SIA - TRV route.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,6,1,4,1,1,4,1,no

singapore airlines,Kevin Tunnicliffe,2019-11-10,"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Brisbane via Singapore. I've been intending to try Singapore Airlines for some time and was keen to know if the reality matched the star rating. The quality of the product, seat and service onboard and on the ground met my expectations fully. The only slight quibble, and it is very slight, is that no amenity kit or pyjamas are offered in business class. The usual amenity kit contents are available as individual items, however in the bathrooms. The seat was excellent, food met expectations and was better than many others. The IFE offering was a little disappointing however and they ought to make a bigger effort here.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,9,5,5,4,3,5,4,yes
singapore airlines,Jairo Lizarazu,2019-11-09,Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Singapore. Our outbound flight experience was enhanced and made pleasant by the service and conversation with Kelvin. Our needs were competently met and exceeded. Our return flight was equally satisfying by the personal attention shared to us by  Beverly. A lengthy flight of 15.5 hours felt relaxing and enjoyable because of her care in customer service. Amazing comfort and travel.

singapore airlines,J Karali,2019-11-09,"✅ Trip Verified |  Colombo to Sydney via Singapore. I thought I loved Singapore airlines and it seemed okay (not great) when I flew from Sydney to Colombo. But then I had the rudest experience when I travelled back to Australia. The air hostess in my cabin were pretty rude. It's like they just want to get their job done and they don't care about the people. I've travelled a lot on different airlines and Ive never been treated so rudely.  They barely offer water to people.  I wanted the chicken as i do not eat beef and they wanted me to have the beef and when i said i can't. They took a long time (everyone else had finished eating) to find me some fish meal that wasn't on the menu.  I was grateful. However, that nice gesture didn't last for long. I literally opened my food to eat and the air hostess just dumps an ice cream (magnum) on my tray. Everyone else was happy to get theirs, but I had only begun (not even) eating! I had to gobble my food and eat the melting ice cream!  And on this very flight the air hostess serving me just took the cup in which there was apple juice remaining and poured me water. I also asked them for water when leaving the aircraft and they hesitated and made me stay the whole time until everyone left to get me the water (which was also a very small cup).  On a good note, I must say the flight is comfortable and good. And the food is acceptably good. I'd ask everyone who loves staying hydrated on flights to make sure they fill up their own water bottles.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,6,4,1,2,4,4,3,no
singapore airlines,Elaine Loh,2019-11-07,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Amsterdam. Great service in business class. The seats are comfortable and the sky bed opens flat for a good night’s sleep. The timing of this flight is great because it leaves at midnight and by the time dinner is served, it is between 2 to 3 am. This gives some adjustment to jet lag and arrives in Amsterdam in the morning. I started sneezing due to sinuses and the air stewardess promptly gave me a large pack of tissues, which came in handy. The entertainment selection was good - although I think Qatar is more current in terms of movie selection. Book the cook never fails. My bak chor mee came with vinegar on the side. For breakfast, I had the healthy red rice fish porridge, which doesn’t sound great but is really amazing. I started off to a busy work day well thanks to Singapore Airlines.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,10,5,5,5,4,5,4,yes

Meals are not bad, although this is my 3rd time having the same dish in the last month - not sure how often the menu changes. Service is good. There was 2 pre-meal drinks runs plus the lunch, followed by after meal drinks.

singapore airlines,John Roder,2019-11-06,"Not Verified | We flew Singapore Airlines business class on an A350 Brisbane to Tokyo via Singapore. The meals on the Brisbane to Singapore were as normal not interesting but the Singapore Tokyo flight the bento box was 5 star. The flight crew were great. The Osaka flight on a B787 again the bento box was 5 star and all the crew helpful and understanding to everyone. The B787 in business class the seats were smaller than usual and the plane was noisy than the A350. The flight home Singapore to Brisbane, a passenger heard the crew talking that they rush the meals and turn off the lights. Well after take-off they were no drinks supplied but a rushed meal service which was not interesting (why do they not do a meal service that they do from other capitals). They did not even supply bottles of water after the meals service like on other flights. This crew were not efficient.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,6,4,1,1,4,4,3,yes
singapore airlines,H Darvani,2019-11-05,"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to New York, everything was organized and on both way aircraft was spotlessly clean. A380 configuration offers privacy even in economy class by dividing the cabin into sections. I would recommend the upper deck because of seat density and less engine noise. The legspace is okay but then I am a tall person. The cabin crew were excellent and the food served was of good quality though I believe they should make the main course portions larger, as EK does. Nothing was too much trouble for cabin staff and they made flight a pleasant experience by looking well after us. This flight reiterated my belief that SIA is the best!",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,8,3,5,3,4,5,4,yes
