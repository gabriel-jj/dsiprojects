cathay dragon,Felix Jiaxin ZHU,2020-04-26,"Not Verified |  Nanjing to Hong Kong. Nice airline, good food. Seat quality maybe not as nice as a Boeing 777. Aircraft looked pretty clean, flight crew was kind,  not a 5-star airline but it must be a 4-star. The TV was not in such a good condition. ",Family Leisure,Economy Class,8,4,5,5,3,5,4,yes
cathay dragon,A Berlov,2020-03-19,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hanoi to Hong Kong. There are new business class seats on the plane, very pleasant and comfortable. The food is good, the choice is standard. Stewardesses good and pleasant service",Solo Leisure,Business Class,8,5,5,4,3,3,3,yes
cathay dragon,JJ LIM,2020-02-07,"✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong to Okinawa Naha. Overall - A very pleasant flight. The only two gripes I have was that they changed the plane to a narrowbody A321 when the flight was supposed to be operated on an A330, and the other being that the legroom on the A321 was not as generous as their widebody aircraft (but then again, every A321 is going to offer lesser legroom). With that out of the way, everything else was done right. Boarding was seamless, cabin crew were very professional and courteous, and up-to-date IFE was offered even on the narrowbody A321. Meals were provided too. Not much time was wasted on the ground and we were airborne before scheduled time. All in all a very pleasant flight.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,8,5,5,4,5,5,3,yes
cathay dragon,Keng Leong,2020-01-30,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. Have flown this route many times connecting from Chicago on Cathay Pacific. In the past service and food has been ok. However, on this trip noticed that the service manager delivered the menu to the 5 or 6 passengers first and addressing each by their name, but I was completely ignored. Only after these passengers were served was I given the menu in silence. ",Solo Leisure,Business Class,1,3,1,3,3,3,3,no
cathay dragon,Claudio Operti,2019-12-14,"✅ Trip Verified |  Qingdao to Hong Kong return in Business Class. Impressive experience, I did not expected such outstanding service on a 3-hours flight. Comfortable 2x2x2 seat arrangement, large seats (even if they cannot become a flat bad - but this is not required on such flight), large video screen with wide selection of movies, also very recent. Full meal with several courses served both ways, very good food and wine, with continuous refills of drinks, very kind and efficient cabin crew. Surprisingly service on this flight was better than on the following Hong Kong - San Francisco flight with Cathay Pacific - I was expecting the opposite. Flight from Qingdao left 40 minutes late (which is the rule for every flight leaving from Qingdao, airport is far too small for the present traffic volume) but arrived Hong Kong in time. Flight back perfectly on schedule, and no issues with luggage.",Business,Business Class,10,4,5,5,5,5,5,yes
cathay dragon,William D Webster,2019-11-04,"Not Verified |  We are very disappointed in Cathay Dragon. We booked a flight from Hong Kong to Phnom Penh on Oct 30, 2019 because they advertised it was on a roomy A330, but the airlines substituted a smaller A320. If we had been notified of the change and given the chance to change our flight date to an A330 we would have done so. ",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2,1,3,1,1,3,2,no
cathay dragon,R Sanyal,2019-10-08,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Kolkata. An excellent flight where I was doted on by two very amiable and helpful cabin crew members. It helped that I was one of just two passengers in the business class section which had 8 seats in two rows of 2x2. A menu card was provided and my selection was tasty and filling. A good complement of drinks and spirits was on offer. However, they have not changed their dessert, a small cup of Haagen Daz ice cream, in at least 7 years. It is always served solid frozen - I passed on it and had some port wine instead. The flight departed on time from a satellite terminal which was reached by a short bus ride from the main terminal. Arrival was on schedule. Indian government landing cards, required of foreigners, were provided on board. The seats are traditional business class recliners and were reasonably comfortable. Boarding was smooth, intermixed with main cabin travelers, through a jet way. I-pads with a small selection of films and shows were provided soon after take off. It was difficult to slot them into the metal clasps on the back of the seat in front of you; you needed to hold on to the i-pad to watch your program. Magazines and newspapers on offer. Lots of storage space overhead. Leg space could be a tad extra - once you recline fully, your toes juts on the bottom of the front seat. Announcements were made in clear English and for a very thoughtful touch, also in Bengali, the language of the destination city. Cathay Dragon had a duty free catalog and three of my four selections were available for purchase. This is one aspect of travel I very much enjoy as it lets me pick up last minute gifts.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,9,4,5,5,3,4,4,yes
cathay dragon,L Hong,2019-09-08,"✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong to Xi'an. Being the second time travelling with Cathay Dragon, my impression towards this airline is greatly improved. In my flight to Xi'an, except for my IFE that failed to show the flight map, everything just went right and nothing special happens, the cabin crew also provided good service to us. However as things went wrong in the return flight back from Xi'an to Hong Kong, the excellence of the Cathay staff is well demonstrated. As the Hong Kong Airport Authority restricted flights from landing in Hong Kong that day, after we entered the cabin with the door closed, we were still not sure whether we can fly. The cabin crew reacted professionally to answer many enquiries from passengers, meals were served on ground and we could just wait for further notifications from the pilot. Finally, the flight was delayed to the next day, we were then forced to leave the cabin and went back to the airport, the only thing that made me discontented is that there was no any compensation from the airline, though the airport restriction issue is not the problem of the airline. In the delayed flight next day, we saw the same crew and they also showed how professional they are. After knowing that it is the birthday of one of our friends, they even provided snacks and gifts to us. Their quality of service was just awesome and left us very deep impression. It is really an unforgettable experience travelling with Cathay Dragon and it is definitely a yes if I have a chance to travel with them once more!",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,9,4,5,4,4,3,4,yes
cathay dragon,R Gonzaga,2019-09-02,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong the first leg of a trip to IAD. Check-in at KLIA was very efficient and the check-in staff were very helpful. The boarding process was handled well with CX staff on hand making clear announcements. The plane was old and tired and the tray table was dirty, stained with spilled food and orange juice. On board, the FAs were pleasant and efficient but that's where it ended. There was no personal interaction of any sort. They did their jobs well and efficiently but that's it. The food was disappointing, small portions and not great in flavour. The IFE was good with an extensive choice of programs. Generally an unremarkable experience but we did leave on time.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,6,3,4,2,4,5,4,yes
cathay dragon,S Vickers,2019-09-02,✅ Trip Verified | Wuhan to Hong Kong. Overall the experience was wonderful. The flight was delayed for around one hour and meal was provided at the gate. The meal was even better than those served in cabin on many Chinese domestic airline's flights. Cabin crew were nice and friendly.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,9,4,5,5,,4,5,yes
cathay dragon,S Vincent,2019-08-19,"✅ Trip Verified | 
Hong Kong to Wuhan with Cathay Dragon. The food and wine is great! The seat is very comfortable. Though it's a very short flight, the seat allows you to lay down as much as possible. Cabin crew are friendly.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,9,5,5,5,,5,5,yes
cathay dragon,W Tan,2019-08-19,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Hong Kong to Kaohshiung in October 2018. Dimsum For Breakfast, no other menu, the dumpling is delicious but i don’t really like the radish cake, but the service was good, crowded flight. Quite a jam for toilet.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,6,4,4,3,3,4,3,yes
cathay dragon,Chun Sing Poon,2019-07-27,"✅ Trip Verified | From KUL to HKG, travelling by A330. The comfort of the seat is fine and the headrest can adjust to different angles. The width of the seat and the legroom is quite large. Although there are many films or TV for you to watch, the size of the personal televisions is very ordinary or even quite small (9 inches). The service of the crew is ordinary too. The meal is sufficient and they provide chicken pasta, salad, ice-cream, drinks and cookies.",Business,Economy Class,7,4,3,5,4,3,3,yes
cathay dragon,A Pybus,2019-06-15,"✅ Trip Verified | Cathay services have, like most airlines got worse as efforts to cut costs and remain competitive mean a slip in food quality, cancellations, code sharing, crammed flights etc. and the food quality has dropped markedly in addition to their reliability. However, I would still say that on this particular route they are still the best airline (not much of an accolade as all the other airlines are budget/Chinese). I have travelled this route (Hong Kong to Shanghai) almost every weekend for over a year and have been a regular user of Cathay for over 15 years. One thing that has caused immense inconvenience and in my opinion negates any advantages of this airline is that most flights, upon landing is to taxi the furthest gate. The gate is so far away that it takes 25 minutes to drive the plane there after landing. Due to the remoteness a bus is used so takes a good 40 minutes to get to the terminal building. This is a super cheap ‘gate’ that is used almost exclusively by Cathay (occasionally other budget airlines if their gates are being used. Their insistence on using this gate creates delays and often hours in a holding pattern until the spot clears. I understand the needs for economies to be made but surely a strategy that creates so much hassle and late arrivals could be replaced with something else? I wish they would just remove in-fight entertainment and get a decent slot! Friends I have who are cabin crew are miserable and report that moral is very low within the organization because of constant complaints and dissatisfaction from passengers. Not having a movie on a 2 hour flight is much less hassle than catching the same flight every Friday for almost a year and all but one being 1-3 hours late. Please sort it out Cathay I can’t keep sucking up this disregard for passengers for much longer, even the pilots are annoyed!",Business,Economy Class,7,3,4,3,3,2,3,yes
cathay dragon,L Tam,2019-05-26,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Zhengzhou. This is the first time for me to travel with Cathay Dragon. Overall, I think that this flight to Zhengzhou is satisfying and it basically meets with the quality that the Cathay Group provides. The cabin staff are nice and the seats are comfortable. As for the food and beverage, I think they are satisfactory, not too bad but not too tasty, the Häagen-Dazs ice cream is probably the food that I appreciated the most. The only thing that I want to criticize is that no in-flight entertainment is installed on the A320 fleet of Cathay Dragon, passengers need to download the KA Studio app in order to enjoy their in-flight entertainment. However even though I have downloaded the app in prior, it still requires me to download patches after getting on the plane, and I could not figure out how to use it, therefore the only thing I could do with the app is looking at the flight map, which is quite disappointing for such a world-class airline.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,7,4,4,3,2,4,3,yes
cathay dragon,Yuxie Zhuang,2019-04-30,"✅ Trip Verified |  Shanghai to Hong Kong. The flight delayed about 70min due to air traffic control at HKIA and process out of order allocating boarding gates at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. But the crews tried to provide a smooth and flexible service. The meals,to be sure, were not enough when it comes to the portion,even as refreshment, and the chicken noodles looked less tasty (but after all tasted well). Due to turbulence on air, the service operated a bit slowly but enough.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,7,5,5,3,4,4,4,yes
cathay dragon,W Shen,2019-04-29,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cathay flight from Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong, which used to operate by Cathay Pacific, has been downgraded after taken over by Cathay Dragon. The overall service was not the Cathay shall have, perhaps this is because it is still a Cathay Dragon flight, not Cathay Pacific in reality. (Is it means that we cannot anticipate the same quality of services even it was claimed under same group?) I do not sure how serious Cathay group is treating this route, maybe you have already downgrading as it is not important to you, but as a frequently flyer between these two cities and cities within China mainland, I shall not try again or recommend to my colleague or overseas partners. KA730 on 19 April, there was NO welcoming drink even a cup of water was requested twice before I was attended (water was asked 10 mins after seat belt sign was switched off which is reasonably fulfilled safety requirements). Wine is no more an option for meal, only on request and only served when asked twice for my second cup, was attended. I can strongly feel the flight attendant was not happy/willing to serve the passengers as they were leaving/walking so fast to avoid further requests.  Meal was standard, but without hot tea! I felt uncomfortable as air-con was not strong enough.  In my return flight on 26 April (KA727), it was another unpleasant experience with KA. Flight was delayed. I was informed at the HK airport, without knowing reason. I felt fine as I was too early (5pm) to be known, even when a friendly staff at the airport counter was politely asked me to check with the gate for details. I do understand there is always an unexpected or inevitable reason of flight delay, but nobody can tell us what was happened, including staff at the gate. They were not even looking at their customer who was asking for details and kept instructing me to be waited.  No answer was given, including the captain and the flight attendant manager, no apology, no info about the delay, they just treated as delay was not happened! The worst part was, when I was trying to use the headset, I found out that the plastic package was opened, and a hair was attached on it! The flight attendant was not felt sorry, and just dragged the headset from me and looked at me, until I asked if I can have a replacement.",Business,Economy Class,3,2,1,1,3,3,2,no
cathay dragon,Raphael Chan,2019-04-25,"✅ Trip Verified |  Shanghai to Hong Kong. This flight is still a satisfying flight, with friendly flight attendants, and fine seats. The food on the plane is not that good on this flight. A small size dish with small size rice. The rice is actually too cold to make itself hard again. The USB adaptor is bad which doesn't allow you to charge your phone properly.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,7,4,4,3,4,4,4,yes
cathay dragon,C Han,2019-04-24,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Shanghai PVG. The trip is actually nice. Flight crews are friendly and nice. The seats are comfortable but the space between each row is quite small, which doesn't allow me to have enough space to stretch myself. There are a lot of movies on the plane, but not quite up to date. About the meal, The rice there is hard, but the other is actually ok, acceptable.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,8,4,4,3,4,4,4,yes
cathay dragon,L Yung,2019-04-19,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Hangzhou. Very poor service with no clear explanation for flight delay. This airline always delays one flight with fewer customers in order not to delay other flights with more customers. For example, the flight from Hong Kong to Hangzhou (Flight number KA622) is frequently delayed for 3-4 hours due to airline’s poor operations of flight schedules but not because of weather conditions.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,5,3,3,3,3,4,2,no
cathay dragon,Francis Wong,2019-04-15,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cathay Dragon does the only direct flights to Penang from Hong Kong, which is code shared with MH. 2 flights a day using the older A330, but with updated interior and AVOD system. Boarding in Hong Kong is orderly, service is friendly and warm, majority of the crew are ladies. Catering however, is a little below average due to severe cost cutting, portion is very small and taste is bland. For some reasons, catering on the return sector, prepared by Malaysian kitchen tasted slightly better. Seats are ok, 2-4-2 is 8 across, giving slightly more room, it's rare nowadays. Cathay Dragon and Cathay Pacific now shares the same AVOD system, which means there are plenty of choices for films and music etc. My Sapphire status earned me a visit to the newly renovated Cathay Pacific lounge in Penang, this is a very nice lounge, compare to the other Plaza premium lounge. My bags arrived quickly on both legs, all in all I had a good trip with them.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,7,3,4,2,4,4,4,yes
cathay dragon,Chong Chern Peng,2019-04-06,"Not Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong. These planes are really old. not the first time taking Cathay Dragon flight from KL to Cathay, but discovered that most of the A330 are more than 20 years old, most probably these planes are passing on from Cathay Pacific. Food was just so so, no wine or blanket was offered. The cabin service is fine, no complain. I just wish Cathay Dragon should consider getting new planes to operate.

cathay dragon,Yuxie Zhuang,2019-01-29,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong. Great journey.

cathay dragon,A Wong,2019-01-24,"✅ Trip Verified | I've been flying Cathay Dragon for decades now (i.e. even when they were their own airline as Dragonair). They are seen as a regional carrier, and it is definitely reflected in the choice of aircraft, and the significantly less elaborate in-flight service, despite similar prices to Cathay Pacific whenever both airlines fly the same route. On my flight to Siem Reap, I was pleasantly surprised to see a significant increase in proper jet bridge boarding whenever airports offered this - a welcome change to airstairs, and it is nice that they have a ""wifi"" device IFE streaming service onboard, but like United, it annoyingly requires you to download their studio KA app, something you will have to do before boarding the plane. That being said, the selection of movies and shows onboard was decent. Seats are fine, but I found the seatback pocket somewhat crowded with their own materials (safety cards, in-flight magazines, etc.) to the point that it was difficult to fit anything inside of it. It made me think of other airlines and their shorthaul economy classes, and how they actually give a separate plastic compartment near the top of the seatback. Seeing as I haven't flown on the Cathay Dragon A320 for a while, I was pleased to see the new seats, and the fully refurbished cabins, which made the decade-old planes look new and clean, though I'd also note that the seats are narrower than they were during the Dragonair era. Food onboard is fine, but beverage service is lacking, with only coffee, tea and water as their only options - the coffee infuriatingly was bland and plasticky - it made me wonder if Cathay- one of the world's top airlines could do what most airlines have already been doing and partner up with a decent coffee chain - to name a few examples, United has Illy's, Alaska has Seattle's Best. I will continue to fly Cathay Dragon, because it's a very stable airline and one that I can count on to get me where I need to be in a timely fashion. That being said, their regional project needs work. US carriers have been catching up quite quickly, and while they'll never compete with Cathay Dragon for their routes, it likely unnerves Cathay that their cabin service is now comparable to that of North American carriers.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,7,3,3,2,4,3,3,yes
cathay dragon,Yuxie Zhuang,2019-01-18,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. Felt a bit uneasy due to the late arrival of transit passengers, without IFE functioning.

cathay dragon,S Dalbart,2018-12-20,✅ Trip Verified |  Chiang Mai to Hong Kong. This was the first time choosing this company and it was just great. Everything was efficient since I entered the airport. Staff was warm welcoming and helpful. The seat was not the best but still comfy enough. Food was great bearing in mind it was a short haul. Nice presentation of the food. On the way from Hong Kong our plane broke so we had to wait for another one. However the staff took care of us very efficiently. I was very impressed and will fly with them again if possible.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,7,3,4,4,,5,4,yes
cathay dragon,Sai Hin Chung,2018-11-03,"✅ Trip Verified | The flight from Hong Kong to Taipei was eventually operated by Cathay Pacific plane and staff, though it used to be a Cathay Dragon flight.

The crew was exceptionally efficient. However, the boarding was quite confusing.",Family Leisure,Business Class,9,5,5,5,5,4,5,yes
cathay dragon,R Sanyal,2018-11-01,"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft appeared to be very new. On time boarding through jet bridge but take off delayed by over 30 minutes because of technical faults. Cockpit crew kept passengers informed. Business class cabin consists of 8 seats in 2 rows of 2 x2 configuration. Standard business class seat with good recline and extended foot rest. iPad provided which had a smaller collection of items than on offer at Cathay Pacific. An amenities kit similar to Cathay Pacific was provided. Smooth flight. Quiet cabin. Only five of 8 seats taken. Attentive flight attendant. Announcements made in Bangla in deference to the destination and the flying clientele - nice thoughtful touch that truly made you feel you were going home! A menu card listing three entree choices was provided. It was a tasty meal accompanied by a choice of wines. The dishes had a noticeable Indian slant. I enjoyed my vegetarian choice. The dessert was a small tub of Haagen Daaz ice cream - something that has not changed in six years. The ice cream is usually rock solid; flight attendant cheerfully thawed it on request! It was a quiet, flight late late at night. Duty free shopping is available and I was able to get a few items I wanted. Landing cards were provided. The lavatory was clean throughout. Being in the forward cabin, we were the first to disembark.

I had to re check in again despite that previous flight was on Cathay Pacific CX415. Hong Kong to Kota Kinabalu on A320-200 vin a 2 class layout cabin, the seat has been refurbished with the thinner seat. The new seat are not equipped with personal IFE- IFE is only possible by downloading KA studio into mobile device. Hot meal and beverages were provided.

A330-300 parked at the remote parking bay whereby transfer was done by airport bus. The cabin crew welcomed me  upon on boarding. My seat no 23H is located at the 1st section of the economy class. This aircraft is equipped with the newer version of IFE with HD screen and 3D flight path. Considering this is a 3 hours 55 mins flight, the quality of the in flight catering is slightly below my expectation. The airline has reduced the number of portion on the meal tray in the last 2 years. Cabin crew are courteous and attentive but less friendly compare to some major airlines in China. I find that the crew are being very passionate and alert when I requested for a comment form after meal and the senior flight attendant immediately came to check if anything was wrong which they can improve on. To conclude, the overall flight journey is still an impressive one.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,9,5,5,4,5,4,5,yes

Boarding process was smooth.  I was welcomed by cabin crew as I boarded. The flight departed on time. Lunch was served soon after take off, a hot meal and cold beverages. In my opinion, the inflight catering can be further enhanced as the meal portion has been reduced in the past 2 years. To conclude, the flight was a memorable and pleasant one.

Soon after take off, the cabin crew distribute paper bag which contains pastry and a packet of lemon tea. Hot meal was not available for economy class passengers.  As the load for this flight was light, cabin crew spent most of the time at the galley soon after they collected the rubbish. I noticed Cathay Dragon in flight meal has deteriorated over the past few years. Meal portion for instance is getting smaller.

cathay dragon,Tshung Ching Tay,2018-10-16,"✅ Trip Verified |  Zhengzhou to Hong Kong in March 2018. Zhengzhou Airport is connected by modern train. It takes less than half an hour from the city centre. I arrived 3 hours earlier and proceed to the check in desk. At that time, there were already passengers waited at the counter. Nonetheless, flight information is neither available or displayed. Soon the counter commenced check in process, the queue was not in systematic order. We were only being informed that the queue was for another direct flight to Taipei. Flight KA749 originally scheduled on 16:20 has been delayed. As a result of that, I shall not be able to catch my connecting flight to Taipei. The ground staff re arranged the last flight for me via CX408. Boarding call was made at 17:30, It was systematic, row by row, priority given to special needs passengers. Being a Marco Polo green member, I took advantage of the special lane dedicated for the frequent flyers. An A330-300 with 3 class cabin configuration was assigned for this route. The captain made an apology while awaiting for take off clearance. The cabin crew busy assisting passengers to avoid further delay. This aircraft is equipped with the older generation IFE. Despite that the aircraft cabin has been refurbished with the newer seat, there are still a clear sign of ageing on this aircraft. Flight KA 749 with light load only took off around 18:30. Dinner was served approximately half an hour after take off. Meal was served with cold beverages. In flight meal also comes with Haagen Dazs ice cream. The cabin crew returned to serve hot beverages. Such process saves time and without the need for the second round meal cart. Meal tray was collected once dinner was done., thus enabling us to have enough time to rest.

cathay dragon,M Barton,2018-07-08,"✅ Trip Verified |  First experience flying Cathay Airlines and I will never return. The only airline that I am aware of that offers ""0"" points for miles earned while booking economy. Not only that, but once booked, cannot upgrade at any cost to a higher class cabin. Cannot use miles to upgrade seating class.  One would think that paying over 1400 dollars and booking direct the airline would accommodate requests especially if seats were available and the customer offered to pay for the upgrade. But not with this airline. The staff both in flight and ground level were the most unprofessional encountered with an airline. The inflight crew found it most appealing to joke and banter amongst themselves rather than attend to passengers. The ground staff cold, not accommodating, and rude to the upmost degree.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,no
cathay dragon,H Chen,2018-07-03,"✅ Trip Verified |  Shanghai to Hong Kong. Reached the airport 2 hours earlier. The ground staff offered me an earlier flight back to Hong Kong. A very flexible arrangement. The flight was very light load and the staff was exceptionally friendly. Food and drinks served once after take off. They offered a very wide range of wine and cocktails. And have 3 different choices on the entrees, which include a special Singaporean dish. The flight was a little bit bumpy and not hot drinks were served. The business class seats were not really spacious, but okay for a 2 hours regional flight. This would be an area they can improve.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,9,3,5,5,5,5,5,yes
cathay dragon,C Sun,2018-05-26,"✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong to Taipei. It was a evening flight and they operated this very short haul route with a wide body aircraft with personal TV. Only snacks were provided with no main course, which was quite disappointing. Cabin crew was efficient and they managed to offered me customised drink in a short time. Flight was a bit delayed due to traffic. The overall experience was fine except the food.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,8,5,5,3,5,5,5,yes
cathay dragon,K Galhera,2018-05-22,✅ Trip Verified |  Bangalore to Hong Kong. Pathetic is the word for this late flight. No delay announcements. Cabin Crew highly unprofessional. Food Quality and quantity useless. Cabin Crew incompetent; even water not served with food? One has to ask for it. What else to mention - overall bad experience with Cathay.,Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
cathay dragon,H Chan,2018-05-09,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Taipei. Check in was efficient with almost no queue. I was informed to have a free upgrade to business class from the economy because of overbooking. No lounge access was given though. The product was a very typical regional business class with no flatbed, and the storage space in the seat was not enough and I must put my small backpack in the overhead compartment. Also, the phone pocket was too small which I couldn't even put my iPhone 7 in. However, PTV was also available in this very short sector single-aisle plane. The 70 minutes flight was operated by a very cheerful team. Cabin crew was efficient and friendly with a very positive attitude. For food, welcoming drinks were available and a full English breakfast was served with juice and wine after take off, with fresh fruits and freshly heated bread. The movie selection in the IFE system was very up to date with hundreds of movies available, though I had no time to finish one in the short flight. Can't believe they still offered a full service within 70 minutes.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,10,4,5,5,5,5,5,yes
cathay dragon,P Beale,2018-02-27,"✅ Trip Verified |  Shanghai to Hong Kong. A reasonable regional business class offering. Seats are nothing special in a 2x2x2 layout with minimal recline and space, but are sufficient for a short range business class flight. Generally, Cathay Dragon aircraft are old and this was no exception with this particular A330 being 21 years old. Crew were friendly and attentive and food selection was ok. I feel that Cathay Dragon is very middle of the road in terms of what it offers at the front end of the cabin.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,7,3,4,4,3,3,4,yes
cathay dragon,S Neane,2018-02-05,✅ Trip Verified |  Manila to Hong Kong. The cabin was spacious and clean. I understood that we did not have any IFE monitor because it was just an hour and 55 minutes flight but they have this entertainment portal that you can access via your phone but it did not work at all so that was a flop. The cabin crew were not helpful at all. They were really bossy and it seems like they were not enjoying their job and would not smile. I would not fly with them again.,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,6,4,1,3,1,4,3,no
cathay dragon,Junke Huang,2018-01-27,"✅ Trip Verified |  Guangzhou to Hong Kong. A short distance flight, depart on 22:00 and just one hour flight. Cabin crew are so busy when on board because they have to prepare many things in a short time. After boarding, cabin crew gives a towel and a cookies to everyone and a bottle of a drinking water is in front of the seat.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,10,5,5,5,,4,5,yes
cathay dragon,Z Gan,2017-12-28,"✅ Trip Verified |  Shanghai to Hong Kong. Arrived at airport 90 minutes before departure time. Check-in counter informed me that I could take an earlier flight. With my consent, rebooking was immediately done and boarding pass issued. There were only 3 passengers in business class cabin. Cabin crew was very friendly, attentive and professional. After take off, dinner was served. Food is well prepared and perfectly done. Seat is comfy for a 2 hours flight. Arriving punctually. For me, Cathay Dragon is the best airline between China mainland and Hong Kong. ",Family Leisure,Business Class,10,5,5,5,5,5,3,yes
cathay dragon,G Lang,2017-10-26,"✅ Verified Review |  First flight with Cathay Dragon from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Generally it was fine. The PTV was great with lots of movies to choose from and KA provides free on-board earphone. However, the breakfast was not that good. Although I usually don't expect a lot in economy, I would say the hot breakfast was below average. The aircraft which was an A330 was nearly 20 years old, but the overall maintenance was nearly excellent. Clean washrooms and comfortable seats for a short-haul flight. The staff in Shanghai Airport really need to improve their service attitudes.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,7,4,3,3,4,3,4,yes
cathay dragon,Frankline Loo,2017-10-24,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Cathay Dragon from Hong Kong to Beijing. Ground check in was smooth at Hong Kong Airport. The ground crews were friendly and attentive. A good sign that we were in good hands onboard Cathay Dragon. Seat asignment was be 3x3. Seat pitch and width are pretty roomy for a guy like me at 179cm in height with moderate 78Kg in weight. Cabin crews were friendly, attentive, polite and well groomed. Food and drinks was top quality and they serve Haagen Dazs Ice Cream for dessert. Will recommend them to other travellers and will choose them again.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,10,5,5,5,5,5,5,yes
cathay dragon,L Tee,2017-10-23,"✅ Verified Review |  Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. My first time boarding this airline. Very friendly, polite, cheerful cabin crews and excellent service. Food and beverages is very good and actually better than their sister airline Cathay Pacific.  Will definitely recommend them to other travellers. Will fly them again in future.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,10,5,5,5,5,5,5,yes
cathay dragon,Victor Sun,2017-10-05,"✅ Verified Review |  Okinawa Naha to Hong Kong. Check-in and ground service at Naha airport were handled by JAL staff, which made the experience fantastic. A clean and well-maintained narrow body plane with on demand inflight entertainment system. Food was mediocre but service by crew members was good. Seat was comfortable, not thinly padded. No jet bridge available at Hong Kong, and a bus was used to transfer passengers to the satellite terminal, after which passengers are treated with a long walk and additional transit train service before arriving at border control. A usual long wait for baggage at HKG.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,8,5,4,3,4,4,4,yes
