pakistan intl airlines,A Sarqir,2020-06-04,✅ Trip Verified |  I will never use this airline again because of the way they handled COVID-19 situation. They cancelled flights and are only operating special flights so that they can charge triple fare. They have been cancelling commercial flights without notifying the passengers. When all other flights have decreased their fare in this pandemic. They are only greedy for money and taking advantage of this situation. ,Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,,1,1,no
pakistan intl airlines,L Malban,2020-03-27,"✅ Trip Verified |  Birmingham to Islamabad. I am severely disgusted in PIA for the way in which they have handled the crisis of COVID-19. Having cancelled all of their flights up to April 5th, they have not sent out any confirmation e-mails regarding this. When I rang the airline contact centre, they told me my flight has been cancelled however they will not book me and my father onto the emergency flights leaving the same date (29.03) and same time (11.50am) as our original flights. When I queried why, he just told me he could not. I asked to speak to his manager which he refused and also would not provide me with his managers name. I further asked him for a confirmation e-mail my flights have been cancelled and he refused to do this. He then went on to cut the call on me. I am so disgusted this is the kind of service PIA provide to it's loyal customers. Do not ever book with this airline. There is no on flight entertainment.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,,,,,,1,no
pakistan intl airlines,A Khan,2020-03-14,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew executive economy from London to Karachi and Islamabad to London. State of the aircraft is pathetic, old and decrepit. Seats are broken and no IFE available so it’s a horribly long flight with nothing to do. On the way to Karachi cabin crew were average and the food was absolutely horrible. On the return the cabin crew were once again average but one male attendant in business class went above his duty for my mum, very professional chap he was. On the return the food was ok but my luggage took 90 minutes to arrive which is appalling. Overall I wouldn’t recommend PIA, now there is BA I will be flying with them next time as the difference in price isn’t too bad.",Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,3,2,3,3,1,3,2,no

Once we were on the plane cot seats were available and they did not give us when going and when coming back, had to hold baby for 8 hours. Paid so much for 5 tickets and no entertainment for kids, the tv does not even work, seats are ripped, very unhappy with the service. I only wanted direct flight to Lahore because of kids and thought it would be easy, it was so bad I would rather go back middle east airlines and stop over,at least they always gave me a cot and kids had entertainment.

pakistan intl airlines,Niknam Hussain,2020-02-08,"✅ Trip Verified |  Birmingham to Islamabad. Travelled Premium Economy - meaning you travel in the old Business Class seats but get none of the other extras that you would expect on other airlines. Check in at Birmingham was a nightmare in that the luggage allowance is 50Kg and the ""safe"" weight is 23Kg (as stated on the tickets) so this necessitates three pieces of luggage? When checking suddenly informed, only 2 pieces of luggage allowable! Check in lady advises we cling wrap two suitcases together. Much tooing and froing getting the weights ok then spending £17 on clingwrap. Only to be told that the luggage was now deemed ""overweight"" so we had to take to outsize counter! Dragged them there. By now, no time to visit free lounge was at far end of terminal. Onboard seats comfortable and extendable to near flat. Service was good, with attentive and polite staff. Food acceptable, and large portions but preferred my Pret baguette I had purchased in the terminal. No entertainment, nothing! If you could put the screen on, all the channels are blank! Make sure you bring your own screens with you and plenty of power banks as there no plug points. Cabin - hot & clammy - no way of getting any cool air as there are no vents.Lucky by product of being so hot, managed to actually sleep. On disembarking - no special treatment. Service has improved but every thing else is lacking, food, entertainment and state of planes.",Family Leisure,Premium Economy,3,3,5,3,,1,1,no

pakistan intl airlines,Khan Barniq,2020-01-08,"Not Verified |  I have recently flown from Toronto to Lahore using PIA (Pakistan International Airlines). Overall my experience with the plane and airline have been decent. The service and boarding took a bit long however it was eventually completed with no issues. The plane takeoff was also quite smooth and the majority of fly time was good. We only ran into some turbulence once and it only lasted for a minute. Food was given out at usual times with decent quality (Rice, chicken, coffee, water, desert) the food was decent and it satisfied your hunger for the most part.

pakistan intl airlines,M Fiaz,2019-11-11,✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Islamabad - check in at airport was fast and organised. Inside the plane it had very dated cabin look. Blankets and cushions were available. It was a full flight. One of the toilet did not work and was flooded. Cabin crew had no manners and were rather rude. Dinner was tasty and breakfast was also good. Landed 30 minutes ahead of schedule which was great. Return flight to Manchester departed Islamabad on time. On return flight cabin crew were more professional and took good care of passengers. I made a request for something which was immediately fulfilled. Food was tasty. No inflight entertainment as tv screens did not work. This made the journey rather boring. ,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,6,4,3,4,,4,3,yes
pakistan intl airlines,Munzoor Kan,2019-11-07,"Not Verified |  Executive Economy, PIA is offering business class seats at the rates of economy class. After reading the description of executive economy from PIA, I upgraded my ticket to executive economy for my return flight from Islamabad to Dubai at the cost of 27000 pkr on top of what i had already paid for economy ticket. Lounge at Islamabad  airport was acceptable, Very disappointed once boarded the plane, No audio or visual entertainment, Seats were same as economy with bit of extra legroom only, no business class seats as advertised, just a flimsy little curtains dividing front 12 seats from rest of cabin.

Street vendors probably offer better variety of food then what was available on business lounge. Very dull, old, and tired looking place. Obviously no inflight entertainment. Staff was good.

I was told that I can not do this because I need to call from my Canadian number that is on file to ensure that I am indeed the right person requesting the refund. Sure, I say. I get back to Canada and call their Canadian Toll Free number as listed on their official website. Surprise - it is discontinued and does not work. I then check my ticket confirmation e-mail and it has a different Canadian Toll Free number. Sure, maybe they changed it. Call that number - Surprise, also disconnected. Frustrated, I contact their ticketing office in Toronto. After the standard auto greetings, I tried to get a hold of anyone on the line. Nothing. Nobody answers. Then I try each and every option from Sales and Reservations, Customer Support, to the 'General Manager', to the General information line. All of these are unanswered. Nothing. They all go to voice mails - which, again are all FULL. Every single one of the voice mail boxes is full.  I tried to go online and get my refund myself.

We were a family of four and we were not given seats next to each other, which is unreasonable as there were lots of people that weren't in groups that could of easily been allocated different seats. I have traveled with PIA many times. The aeroplane also at times gets extremely hot like the heating is on boiling or something mid air. The food on a few occasions has upset my stomach. The inflight entertainment hasn't been working for the past five years at least each time I've traveled with PIA. The taps in the bathrooms have to be held to let water stream out which means you can't wash your hands properly.

pakistan intl airlines,S Mahadar,2018-09-19,"✅ Trip Verified |  Islamabad to London. We enrolled to become award members, and upgraded to business class seats on our outward bound flight from Heathrow to Islamabad. My husband was suffering shoulder and neck pain and I from lower back pain. We arrived at the boarding gate and were told to wait in the corridor as the seating area was full, looking inside we saw that some passengers were using the seats to put their luggage on, we insisted on being able to get into the seated waiting area and eventually were allowed to go in , once there we asked the passengers to remove the luggage from the seat and let us sit down. The seats in the aeroplane are old style and were not fully functional, they would go flat but we were unable to sit up as they would not pull up enough. We asked the steward to help sort them out they were unable to do so and could not offer alternative seats. They were unable to provide extra pillow or blankets, as they claimed they only carried a limited amount. The food was reasonable but not really presented as one would expect in business class. Having travelled on other airlines business class this fell very short in service and comfort. The cutlery was plastic - really is that the best they can do?? There was no in flight entertainment or newspapers offered. The icing on the cake for this journey was having to wait for our luggage over 2 and a half hours even economy collected their baggage before us. We visited Saddar PIA office and spoke to the Shabbir duty manager there to complain about the service we received, we were told to make a formal written complaint and someone will be in touch within a day or two. Having done this we waited and waited for a response. Needless to say no one called to offer any explanation or any form of remedy. We were seeking to upgrade on our return journey but they were unable to do that as they claimed there system was in the process of being upgraded. Still after a few days no one contacted us. Their phone system is useless we tried calling only to be left hanging on the phone for hours. Eventually you get through and the call attendees cut you off. After a few days we then went into the Islamabad office saw the duty manager to see if we can upgrade, only to be told they are unable to do that as all business class seats are full and their system was not allowing them to upgrade. They checked us in to seats 1A and 1C and gave us paperwork to confirm our seat allocation, No sufficient explanation or compensation was offered for the journey we had already been on. Fresh return tickets in hand. We arrived at the airport in ISB, only to find that the counter clerk had changed the seats allocated saying that they were wrongly allocated by the duty manager at PIA office ISB and he referred the matter to a supervisor who said he needed to speak with that the duty manager at PIA office ISB did not have the authority to allocate those seats to us.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no

pakistan intl airlines,B Martin,2018-08-21,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Islamabad. You will be where I have been, when booking tickets. You use a ticket scanner site and find the cheapest ticket you can for a flight to Pakistan. You see the price of business class on PIA and its half the price of any of the competitors. You say 'wow, ill book that'. This is what you get. Ancient planes with broken seats, scuffed and dirty. No IFE. Screens don't work. This was both ways. Seat didn't work. When the airlines say lie flat seat, you assume when its working it lies flat. Basically for the price, you get a wider seat and more leg room. Food was tasty and plentiful, despite being served from foil trays, and eaten with plastic forks. Staff were average. Some were excellent, some were miserable and offish. No priority boarding or bag tags. I waited 50 mins at Heathrow to collect my bag. I travel business most weeks somewhere in the world. PIA is the worst I've come across.

pakistan intl airlines,I Elrick,2017-07-18,"✅ Verified Review | I was surprised to see Pakistan Intl flying from Tokyo to Beijing so cheaply, so I booked, thinking the flight would be rather short so there would be no room for grave errors. I found out that this is part of a longer itinerary; the plane leaves Beijing and is bound for Lahore and Islamabad. When checking in, I was given an odd boarding pass without a boarding gate or departure time written on it. I was told not to clear security and to await a staff announcement. At least fifteen minutes after the scheduled departure time, it was announced (only in Japanese) that the plane could not depart. While I am lucky to have years of experience with the Japanese language, the Danish travellers in front of me were not so lucky. Overall, the ensuing process on the ground was appallingly disorganized. Although we were asked to neatly line up to receive replacement flights, many people just ended up cutting straight to the front of the line and snatching the best flights. Observing this led the line to dissolve, with a survival-of-the-fittest situation emerging. The airline gave me a flight from Haneda with Air China free of charge. I spent the night with at a friend's, and it was unclear whether they would cover non-Narita hotel costs. Overall, save yourself the trouble.

IFE was a little difficult to use, but I finally figured it out about an hour into the flight. Food was delicious, and cabin crew could not have been any friendlier. My only complaint is the cabin. It looks old and a little worn. All in all, this was a great flight and a great value. I will certainly fly PIA again.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,8,3,5,4,3,4,5,yes
pakistan intl airlines,Us Mangul,2016-08-08,"✅ Verified Review |  I flew from London to Karachi on 24 July and was glad to see televisions on the plane with stats and maps being displayed however after takeoff when I asked a member of the crew, 'when will the TV system start?' they were happily saying with a smile on their face that it may not be possible to get the inflight entertainment system working. What is the point of having TV's when you cant watch movies, play games, etc. So I was stuck with the boring flight displays throughout the 7h 15m flight, At take off, I was taking pictures using my iPad and one of the flight attendants said across the plane, 'can you put it away?' I replied, 'its on flight mode'. Then she loudly shouted 'I am talking to you.' I was very offended by the attitude of the flight attendant however the other flight attendants spoke calmly to the passengers. A few hours after take off, the lights were dimmed but all of the overhead reading lights were not working so when I complained, the crew put the moonlighting on. Also, throughout the flight, drinks were not served except from once with the food and once when the flight attendant served water. On other airlines, flight attendants serve drinks regularly throughout a long flight. On the whole the ticket price was good however the airline seriously needs to realize that the passengers will not be willing to fly with them unless they improve the IFE and the service.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,2,2,2,2,,3,4,no
pakistan intl airlines,Will Hall,2016-07-12,"Manchester to New York JFK with Pakistan Int'l Airlines. Pros - comfortable seating, good crew in general, tasty cuisine, attentive drinks service. Cons - no inflight entertainment for long haul, crew sometimes pushy and slightly older aircraft in need of refurbishment. My story began with a cancelled Delta flight. I was journeying from the UK to the USA for leisure and so had my hotel pre booked. Upon hearing the news of the cancellation, I was also informed of the alternative - an identical flight operated by PIA that would get me to New York for the same time. Upon boarding the aircraft, I was given a complimentary cup of water to settle me down. I quickly realised that 90% of the inflight entertainment systems were completely broken - of course my seat being a defective system. A disappointment, but at least I was on my way. We took of at 13:00 UK time. The seats were surprisingly comfortable with pillows to rest. This allowed me to get some shut-eye, but I did feel as though a sleeping environment was imposed upon us. The crew came to each row and requested that we close our windows. Then, a sort of night sky lighting effect was activated in the cabin. This was one of the strangest requests from cabin crew I had ever received. This did not help me to combat the effects of jet lag, having said it was about midday in New York City at the time. The food service was clearly orientated towards the Pakistani cuisine - which was delicious. I am partial to spicy foods however, but I must say that the meal was very enjoyable. But if curried foods are not your cup of tea, you should bring appropriate foods on board. The second sandwich service was slightly disappointing, with soggy sandwiches and salad. However, specific dietary requirements were not well met. If you are vegetarian, vegan or otherwise, good luck getting food on a PIA flight. Drinks flowed throughout the flight, with regular refreshment 'top-ups' to keep us sane. In general, the cabin crew staff were very helpful, with only a slight language barrier to overcome. Some of the requests were slightly strange and blunt at times, for example, when the gentleman next to myself was stubbornly 'placed' into his seat whilst trying to access the above head lockers. The lack of inflight entertainment was definitely the greatest downfall of the experience. Whether it was due to the clearly aged fleet of PIA aircraft, or the lack of funding or time to replace, PIA really needs to have some form of long haul entertainment for their aircraft. This diminished my overall opinion of the flight, but at least the airline was accommodating to the twenty plus Delta passengers who found themselves stranded at Manchester Airport. PIA is a friendly airline, which could benefit from modernisation and the ability to cater to wider ranges of passenger requirements. If you find yourself in a similar position, or simply wish to investigate PIA, don't worry - PIA will get you to your destination safely, and you will be welcomed aboard. But don't expect the best in terms of service - whilst you will be fed and watered, PIA feels about ten years behind the times.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,6,4,3,1,1,4,4,no
pakistan intl airlines,F Mansoor,2016-04-06,"I have taken this route from Toronto to Karachi many times with Etihad and Emirates. Unfortunately I flew with Pakistan Intl Airlines this time. The most annoying thing is that all TVs on the plane were not working, both times. Hard to pass 13 hours with no entertainment. The food they served on the way to Karachi was awful so on the way back I made sure that I took food onboard with me. Since it's a direct flight, it was full of crying kids, so be prepared for a terrible headache. There is one good thing about this airline - the crew, who were really friendly.

Our flight was on time, however the boarding process was a bit hectic. Aircraft was a repainted Vietnam Airlines Boeing 777, but all the IFE was Vietnam Airlines and all they had were sub-par airplane games. No headphones were given out. Staff were okay, some nicer than others. Food was good - dinner an 8/10 and breakfast, although simple, was a 7/10. Drinks were handed out before dimming, but cabin was not dimmed until 1am - should have dimmed by 11. Blankets were given out but you had to ask for pillows, which meant that I had a poor sleep.

On landing at Karachi I requested for wheelchair so they called an ambulator which came after 30 minutes after the whole aircraft had disembarked. After that we had almost 6 hours connection time between both flights, so PIA arranged for our dinner at airport.

At check-in my baggage was a mere 2kg over the limit and was forced to pay extortionist amount for this whilst at the same time those with ""connections"" were getting away with excess of over 30kg! The plane was dirty. The staff were rude and refused to help vulnerable passengers. The inflight entertainment system was 90% out of order, for those screens that were working the crew failed to provide head phones. The meal was handed out with no choice, when asked the crew replied that is all we are serving. No fresh juices was available apart from the sugary fizzy drinks. Once the meal had been served, crew disappeared and no water/drinks was provided until around 2 hours before landing.

I asked the crew member who was distributing headphones, why bother when entertainment system was not working? She laughed and kept on doing her business. Unfortunately, PIA is the only airline operating direct flights to Pakistan from Toronto and a majority of people, who have days of vacation, cannot afford to lose a day by picking other routes.

We reached Departure area to go towards the checkin, They said we're sorry but PIA hasn't started check-In. It was just 2.5 hrs to take off and they were saying this. At least 200 passengers were standing there. We requested to at least let us in because we had a disabled Passenger with us. But they didn't care about it and made is wait till 8pm. Then eventually we went in, waited in line to get our turn, after some time we got our Luggages Booked and boarding Passes received. It was around 9:30pm and we arrived at our gate. We waited and waited for a long time. At around 11pm, they started boarding. We proceeded to the counter, he gave us our boarding passes and we headed towards the plane. All passengers were boarded. They weren't taxiing. We waited for 2 whole hours. At 1am, after lots and lots of screaming, yelling, shouting, swearing (not only passengers, but also cabin crew) they started taxiing.

No apologies from anyone employed by PIA not even the captain for the delay and no refreshments, not even water was offered let alone alternative accommodation -nothing offered to assist passengers. An airline that is most disappointing and I will not be recommending it. The cabin crew need to learn a bit of customer service and learn to smile. The aircraft was dirty and the toilet roll and soap were not topped up. Cabin crew looked and laughed when I alerted them to this.

The seats had no cushioning and I felt sorry for the elderly who couldn't move around. I took 2 of my sons to get a drink for them and despite the stewardesses seeing that I was holding the boy's hands, she said to carry on serve myself while she carried on chatting with her colleagues. On my return flight, a young child was sick in the walk way and a passenger asked the crew to clean it up because it was in the way, the stewardess gave tissues to the woman and told her to do it herself, unbelievable.

There was no decent food selection available, and the only things on display were packets of pot noodles and 3 cold salami sandwiches. So, as soon as it was announced the gate was open, we fled the lounge and went to the gate. After passing through security, we realised there was a 15-minute delay. Finally, boarding was announced, and, much to my dismay, there was no priority boarding! We finally boarded the flight and were taken to our seats by the cabin crew. Moments later, the purser appeared with a range of juices and hot towels. In terms of seat comfort, I found the seat to be comfortable, and after flying EK's, EY's and QR's Business Class, didn't find it to be all that bad. After a 10 minute delay, we took off, and the IFE was turned on while the crew prepared for snacks, consisting of sandwiches, chicken 'rolls', cake and tea/coffee. After snacks, we began our descent and landed in MXP, and the ground staff cleaned the plane while we remained seated. After everyone had boarded, we were given juices and cold towels again, and soon after, we took off, 10 minutes behind schedule. We were given our amenity kits, and the rest of the flight was uneventful. Dinner consisting of a steak, curry, rice, lentils and vegetables was served, along with dessert, which was cheesecake or a plateful of chocolate eclair and lights were turned off for passengers to go to sleep. I fell asleep and woke up with only 2 hours to ISB when lights were turned on for Breakfast. Breakfast consisted of a sandwich, a croissant, coffee/tea, a roll, cold chicken cuts and a shashlik.

The overnight hotel accommodations provided by the airline in Lahore were awful. Flight from Lahore to Islamabad was uneventful except for the extremely low safety concerns of the cabin staff. There were children running all around the plane even when the seat belt signs were on and even when the aircraft was flying through turbulent weather - what surprised me the most was that cabin staff just ignored these children while I was a nervous wreck watching the children jump around seats and run in aisles.,Business,Economy Class,5,3,2,3,1,4,4,no

After 10 years of flying PIA's Business Class, you get used to the CIP lounge in Islamabad, which, although renovated and refurbished, still lacks a lot when compared to Emirates, Qatar Airways or Etihad. After the long wait, the boarding started slightly behind schedule. Since Islamabad Airport doesn't have jetways, we boarded via stairs, and as we entered the aircraft, I immediately realised that the AC's weren't on. We had to sit in this inferno for about 20-30 minutes before the engines were started. Post-takeoff, menus were distributed and the food trolley was rolled out. The food was delicious, and I even opted for seconds. After lunch, I realised that the IFE wasn't working, and when I flagged down a stewardess to ask why the IFE had failed, her response was ""technical failure"" and was not very helpful. The rest of the flight was uneventful. Business Plus passengers were allowed to de-board first.

You know that a plane is old when they have to use a VHS tape for the safety announcements! The flight was uneventful until the landing. We were only 1000 feet from the ground when suddenly the airplane ascended sharply the captain then came on the pa and announced that a warning light had come on causing the aborted landing but they had determined that everything was okay and would attempt the landing again. The second attempt was successful but I suspect that the landing gear did not fully deploy on the first attempt! The return was uneventful and luckily on a much newer B777. The only problem was that the IFE was not operational during the flight.

The seats were grubby worrn out and dirty the seat pockets seemed to have a years worth of accumulated dirt inside even the walls of the plane were dirty. The attitude of the staff was extremely poor a stewardess decided to ""clean"" trash off the floor by pushing it under my wifes seat with her foot.

The legroom seats were reserved for cabin crew who sat chatting in them for most of the flight prompting a row with one tall customer who refused to move. The plane was an hour late to depart and no announcements at all were made to explain this. The toilets smelt and were the dirtiest I have experienced on any flight. The crew served themselves with water while we waited to take off but none was offered to anyone else. They spent most of the flight monopolising the legroom seats and checking their makeup (they did look good). They forgot to give out the immigration forms for entry to Tokyo until we were leaving the plane causing delays there as we struggled to fill them in in the queue.

The quality of the food was shocking. Cabin was dirty. Aircraft needed lot of maintenance. Staff busy selling duty free items. Return trip was even worse. Wheelchair access was a joke. Used to be a great airline and business travel was excellent. It seems the airline is on purpose being downgraded for a quick sell-off.,,Business Class,5,1,1,1,1,,1,no
pakistan intl airlines,Kamran Baig,2014-07-13,PK772 CPH-ISB 24th May 2014. PK649 ISB-LHE 27 May 2014. PK751 LHE-CPH 28 May 2014. Very good competitive fares including in Business Class. Business Class a bit outdated but for the price it is great. Some staff need client orientation training.,,Business Class,3,3,2,3,2,,5,yes
pakistan intl airlines,M Yasin,2014-07-13,Took flight from Birmingham to Islamabad (economy) on 28th Feb 2014. Interior of the plane was very dirty seats ripped entertainment system didn't work toilet doors had to be banged to shut them. Crew didn't care at all. Meals were inedible and breakfast had no hot drinks. No inflight magazine available. PIA used to be great carrier with excellent food and caring staff. It seems things have changed for the worse.,,Economy Class,9,1,1,1,1,,1,no
pakistan intl airlines,Atif Syed,2014-05-03,Traveled back in January 2013 from Toronto to Karachi. B777-200 condition from inside is worse. The entertainment system was not working at all. They tried to fix it but were not able to do it. Seats were damaged remote was broken. Meal was ok portion was fine. They should fix the entertainment system because its a 14 hour flight.,,Economy Class,8,4,1,3,1,,3,no
pakistan intl airlines,Mohammad Saeed,2014-03-11,PK790 from Toronto to Lahore on May 21 PK307 on June 8th from Lahore to Karachi and on PK783 on June 9 from Karachi to Toronto. 2nd flight schedule PK790 from Toronto to Lahore on Tuesday Nov 19 on PK307 on Dec 7th from Lahore to Karachi and PK783 on Dec 8 from Karachi to Toronto. My experience has been I shall put it very good if not excellent. very comfortable flights. Plane interiors were clean staff very co-operative minor issues like the entertainment system at my seat not working or the fact that on the flight from Karachi to Toronto there were only two meals on offer on a 14.5 hr flight.,,Economy Class,10,4,4,3,3,,4,yes
pakistan intl airlines,Arhat Muneer,2014-03-10,Flew JFK-LHE-ISB in December 2013 and ISB-LHE-MAN-JFK in January 2014. Travelled with PIA after along time and have to say I loved it. The food was excellent. Had some technical issues with IFE on the return flight but they were solved quickly by the crew. The seats were very comfortable. The crew was very helpful and understanding. Good hotel provided during long stopover/delay on return flight. Overall a great experience and above all PIA flies direct to Pakistan. I highly recommend it.,,Economy Class,8,5,4,5,4,,4,yes
pakistan intl airlines,Ahsan Ali,2014-03-03,Lahore to Dubai return (A310). My worst experience with PIA. Both times flight was delayed very poor staff onboard. Meals quality was very low nothing for entertainment. Cabin crew offered us head phones but due to technical faults they were not working when they were inserted on seat arm.,,Economy Class,9,2,3,2,2,,2,no
pakistan intl airlines,M Shah,2014-02-20,My family and I have been using PIA for almost 40 years. The one and only reason I use PIA is that they fly direct to Pakistan. On this particular journey I booked a direct return flight from London Heathrow to Islamabad and then back to London Heathrow. Sadly this is not what I got. My flight was diverted from Islamabad to Karachi then onto London Heathrow. A flight that was meant to take 7.5 hours took almost 12.5 hours. The plane was dirty smelly and unkempt and 1 toilet did not work at all. Another toilet was leaking. More than 60% of the in-flight entertainment was not working. No TV no radio nothing. No explanation as to why. The attitude of the staff was bordering on arrogant. The food was atrocious. Not one apology of the flight being diverted to Karachi. I was travelling with my elderly mother who is a diabetic and the extra journey time had a huge impact on her.,,Economy Class,8,1,1,1,1,,1,no
pakistan intl airlines,Hassan Aftab,2014-02-04,Flight PK731 from Karachi (KHI) to Jeddah (JED) on 27th Dec 2013 on board a Boeing 747-300 (AP-BFY). I was seated on the upper deck of this jumbo seat 92A. It was my second flight with Pakistan International and I was still impressed. Even though the aircraft was an old 747-300 the seat was comfortable and the service was delivered by an attentive and friendly cabin crew. The IFE screen was a small LCD screen which only worked for the Safety Video then after that only a few PTV screens were working. The IFE was the only downside to my flight experience. Other than that I really enjoyed it on the upper deck of this beautiful B743 bird which there aren't many of today.,,Economy Class,,5,5,5,2,,5,yes
pakistan intl airlines,Moeed Khan,2014-01-31,PK-781 ISB-YYZ about 2 years ago. The seats were just okay. IFE was fair though there was less choice of channels. That flight is about 14 hours long but PIA is doing well to keep passengers entertained throughout that long flight. The staff were good. The food was just okay it was not how it should be. The washrooms were clean. The plane was also in good condition.,,Economy Class,,3,4,4,3,,4,yes
pakistan intl airlines,Naseer Khan,2014-01-23,Flew business class LHR to Islamabad overnight and direct. Great flight out slightly delayed due to illness but service inflight was excellent as was food. Seats not horizontal flat bed I believe called angle flat bed but comfortable enough for snatches of sleep. Only 5 people in business class section so plenty of attention from cabin staff when required. Return flight though should have been direct but instead routed via Karachi 4 hour delay! Evening meal arrived one pack of peanuts priced one biscuit and a cup of tea/coffee/juice. Note to PIA delays plane changes and joke meals are not the way to retain your premium paying business class passengers. The inflight staff were excellent but embarrassed on the return leg they were simply let down by operational staff and management.,,Business Class,,3,5,2,3,,4,yes
pakistan intl airlines,Humayune Khalid,2014-01-21,18th January 2014 from ISB-KHI. Aircraft was Boeing 737-800 that had been wetleased from some European country. Aircraft was relatively newer than the older Boeing 737-300 that PIA operated however the seats were cramped and passengers were packed like sardines. Flight was 40 minutes late and I was supposed to come back the same evening at 7pm. As per my booking the aircraft was supposed to be a Boeing 777-200 but flight from Karachi to Islamabad was 4 hours late and the same wet-leased B737-800 clunker in which passengers were squeezed like tuna in a can. There was no IFE and food was provided was a sandwich with cold drinks. I have been travelling PIA for a long time but this was the worst experience. No economy plus no business class. The inflight staff could not speak proper English and were rude.,,Economy Class,,1,1,1,1,,1,no
pakistan intl airlines,Abbas Tanweer,2014-01-13,Travelled between Toronto-Lahore-|Toronto. The ground crew at the airline counter displayed attitude and lacked any courtesy. The food quality on the way to Lahore was just acceptable. On return to Toronto the food portions were not even enough to feed a 6 year old. Also the breakfast was served one hour after takeoff and then no food until next 8 hours. That too was not enough. There was no food/snack/beverage for next 7 hours. 70% of Pakistanis living in North America drink coffee. Coffee was not available for economy class. No more PIA. There are better choices available now.,,Economy Class,,,3,1,3,,3,no
pakistan intl airlines,M Aftab,2014-01-13,PK788 from London-Heathrow (LHR) to Karachi (KHI) on 18th Dec 2013 on a Boeing 777-200ER (AP-BHX). It was my first time flying with Pakistan International as I normally fly with the Arab airlines (Emirates Gulf Air etc). I was amazed by the service delivered to me! The crew were really friendly IFE was working seat was comfortable and in good condition & the meals served were delicious and more food was available upon request. I would say that their service is better than Emirates and a lot of other airlines eg BA. The things I would say that PK need to improve on is the crew uniform aircraft interior and the IFE systems.,,Economy Class,,5,5,4,4,,5,yes
pakistan intl airlines,Yazdani Usman,2013-12-20,Travelled from Peshawar to Karachi and back. The flight was on time and boarding was quick and easy. There was a lack of entertainment on the A310 but being a short flight it wasn't a problem. They did have a drama playing on a projector sort of thing and the headphones were synched with it. The food was delicious and fresh which is usual from PIA. Over-all a good experience. I would recommend it as the entertainment systems on international flight is also now very good.,,Economy Class,,4,5,4,3,,5,yes
pakistan intl airlines,Muzzy Ali,2013-12-12,Went on fairly new B777-300er plane straight from Birmingham to Islamabad meals were nice and the flight was on time no fuss at all. Quick and easy boarding process. I went with my family (6 people 4 adults 2 children) and it only cost me 2000 pounds - great value for money!,,Economy Class,,5,5,5,5,,5,yes
pakistan intl airlines,Huzayfah Alam,2013-12-11,We were flying from Lahore Punjab Pakistan to London Heathrow on-board PIA's Boeing 777-300ER AP-BID on August 31st 2013. We checked in at Allama Iqbal International airport and then headed down for the gate. Breakfast wasn't very nice it was a Burger with a Muffin and a drink however Lunch was excellent! We were served Curry Rice Vegetable curry drinks etc. However then the In-flight Entertainment systems were switched on and only a half of the plane's entertainment system actually worked. This time this aircraft had more working IFE's than my previous PIA flight from LHR to ISB. My sister and mother's IFE worked and we shared that. It was a decent Entertainment system. The staff were friendly they talked to passengers checked if we are okay.,,Economy Class,,4,5,4,3,,3,yes
pakistan intl airlines,R Edward,2013-12-10,Travelled PIA for the first time (LHR-ISB PK786 13/11/13 PK785 20/11/13) to be different from the usual Emirates and was quite pleasantly surprised. Slight delay on departure passenger had to be off loaded but the pilot was very informative and the crew had a pleasant feel to them polite courteous and cheerful - this carried on throughout the flight. The journey was uneventful (as are all flights now a days) and the food - that was scrumptious to say the least. Granted not like the Arab airlines who give you options to keep you content but this food was really nice and I actually had to ask for seconds to which the staff quietly smiled and returned with another helping! The IFE was so so not brilliant but enough to get you through the journey. Overall having flown a many 'third world' airlines I can honestly say PIA is probably the best when compared to its neighbours though still has some way to go to become an Emirates/Etihad.,,Economy Class,,4,5,5,3,,4,yes
pakistan intl airlines,R Iqbal,2013-12-09,London Heathrow to Lahore Pakistan PK758 2 Nov 2013. Returned on 3 December PK757. The only reason we choose PIA is due to the direct flight to Pakistan we have used them for several years. The value of what you pay for is deteriorating. I travelled with a 2 year old and keeping him entertained for over 7 hours is difficult without entertainment. No earphones for the entertainment no pillows and no blankets. The food is getting worse. You get the food shoved in front of you without even being asked what you want. On the way to Pakistan my son wasn't even offered a meal. So if you want to fly directly I suggest you take iPad for entertainment don't expect anything else from PIA. I would never use them again!,,Economy Class,,3,4,1,1,,2,no
pakistan intl airlines,Altaf Ayesha,2013-12-04,Been using PIA for several years. Mainly because of their direct flights from London To Lahore. Have had problems in the past. This time booked tickets 9 months before flight date. Phone PIA a few week before to confirm flight. Only to be told that return flight had been cancelled. No notification by airline. No suitable alternative flights available. Unbelievable!,,Economy Class,,4,5,5,3,,3,no
pakistan intl airlines,Mohammad Asif,2013-10-20,Flew from Multan-Jeddah on PK-731. Basically it was a direct flight but we had a 2 hours stay at Karachi. We where treated with nice meals and good service. Unluckily boarding started 3 hours late in Karachi. We were unaware until we boarded the aircraft that we were going to Lahore to drop passengers and to merge Lahore-Jeddah flight with us. It was a very boring journey with no entertainment and an ageing B-747 aircraft. Although the journey was fine with a helpful and smiling crew. Meals were also nice and delicious.,,Premium Economy,,4,5,5,2,,3,yes
