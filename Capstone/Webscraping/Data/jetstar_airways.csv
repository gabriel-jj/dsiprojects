jetstar airways,E Marcerios,2020-05-05,"✅ Trip Verified |  My friend and I were travelling to Vietnam. We were trying to be cautious and followed Smart Traveller (official governement information published in regards the safety of the traveller) which clearly indicated not to travel and decided not to risk our health and request a voucher. But the problem is that we can't use our vouchers in the future as I am no longer there and my friend will be leaving very soon. So, a voucher doesn't make sense. And we don't want a voucher. We need our money back. We have explained them several times. It is a real shame how they have treated us (my friend, really) on the phone, trying to make us look like fools, trying to make us finish their endless calls with hours put on hold, telling us they would call us back and didn't do it.  We are never again using Jetstar.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,1,,,,,,1,no
jetstar airways,Chris Pokrzywa,2020-04-27,"✅ Trip Verified | I'm absolutely appalled Jetstar is not willing to issue a refund for our flight. We're currently required to shelter in place for our own safety during this world pandemic. Not to mention many of the international borders are closed and we're unable to fly. Yes, we're all affected by this pandemic, and I understand the airline industry is hurting, but don't attempt to profit off of your customers who aren't even able to utilize your services. Issuing your customers a voucher that expires within 6 months is not acceptable. It's not like we can just put our life on pause and travel whenever we wish. These trips take a ton of planning and coordination to pull off, and the fact Jetstar is unwilling to empathize with their customers during this difficult time is a perfect example of the kind of company that puts ethics to the side in order to benefit themselves for the short-term.

jetstar airways,Caryn Jervis,2020-04-21,"✅ Trip Verified | Extremely poor customer service and attempting to profit off a pandemic! My experience with Jetstar has been completely sub optimal. My flight has been cancelled - and despite multiple attempts and hours and hours waiting for live chat or email response, they finally get back and say they can only provide a voucher. This is really a weak offering given every other airline for my trip provided refunds with no questions asked. Then, the most laughable part of all - their voucher is only valid for 6 months! They refuse to adjust the policy. How am I meant to plan and book a trip in the next 6 months with this level of uncertainty and borders being closed? They are trying to gauge passengers. It's despicable. I will never fly Jetstar Airways and I will ensure that my friends, family and community are advised of this behavior. Do not support such a crooked airline. Its businesses like these that deserve to go under during these times, all of my support will go to airlines that also did their best to service their customer and meet needs and expectations.

jetstar airways,P Stein,2020-04-15,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’m very upset with the customer service I received. I booked a flight through Jetstar for the first time to fly from Hawaii to New Zealand and because of Covid-19, Jetstar has to cancel my flight to New Zealand and gave me a voucher instead of a returned payment. During these hard times where I am currently out of a job and trying to pay my rent, I called to see if I could get a refund and had very poor customer service. The man I spoke with continuously talked over me and said it’s a non refundable ticket. I booked with Hawaiian airlines for my return flight which was also non refundable and they gave me a full refund because THEY had to cancel my flight. It is the right thing to do and I will never fly with this airline. People are in need of money right now. The right thing to do is return people’s money when Jetstar has to cancel my flight due to border closures. Terrible, terrible company.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,,,,,,1,no

Staff where horrible and condescending. Was reluctant to help you check out bags but as soon as it came to weighing the they were straight over I can only presume that’s because they saw a cash grab opportunity.

In this case it was $130 to pay for 2 bags (1 per person) that were slightly overweight. They have the scales there ready to go Just before you board the plane and this is despite the check-in baggage allowance being 20kg and therefore no overall additional burden on the aircraft whatsoever. Add to this staff talking down to you like a child!

jetstar airways,K Carroll,2020-03-31,"Not Verified |  This company should be offering refunds not vouchers during the Covid-19 crisis. Beware: They also change your flights without notifying you. Even once the flight is cancelled, they only offer a voucher. They trick their customers out of a refund in which they are entitled to. If you call them to discuss your options, be prepared to be on hold for minimum 4 hours before being disconnected. They give a short deadline to accept a voucher, expecting a decision without being able to discuss your options with them, as they give not other option but a voucher.

Then this evening we have just reserved a message from Jetstar saying they will not be flying us home on the 28th and that the only thing is to give us a voucher, but as we have just discovered the flights that are earlier are over $1200 return per person.

Matters were not resolved we were put in a difficult situation. We had to cancel the flight because of corona virus travel warnings and when we asked if we can get a refund or some date change we were told we are not entitled for a refund and the agent totally mislead us by charging another extra 468 aud per person for a date and flight route change. So in total on top of the booking we have already done of 954 aud we were asked to pay another 865 aud for changing the existing booking. In a situation of a global crisis we were very disappointed of how Jetstar handled the situation. Unfair money suckers. This is how they treat their customer. Such disappointment.

But then I received a text from Jetstar one day before my flight for my online check in and i decided to check in online and i found out my seat was changed to a seat in almost middle of the plane to a middle seat. I called their number and after waiting for 50 minutes i was told i never booked any seat so they have automatically assigned me a seat(middle seat) and when i told them about the email i was told its an automatically generated email and it can be incorrect(are you kidding me) and i had to choose another seat from the few seats still available.

We arrived at the domestic terminal as advised for them to tell us we are flying from the international terminal with no email or notification of this.

The mobile app doesn’t work but even if users did it would be pointless. There was on airport check in counters but only 2 people on the counter to check in 3 flights! Took over an hour from printing boarding passes to be able to drop our bags! If you are going to get people to check in themselves then why not just run a single bag drop lane? It makes absolutely no sense. By the time I got on the cramped and uncomfortable aircraft I was so frustrated that I will not ever fly this carrier again.

jetstar airways,W Richards,2020-03-08,"✅ Trip Verified | 1/28/2020 we flew from Melbourne to Sydney JQ526. The flight was late about one hour. We told the counter rep at Melbourne that we needed to catch next flight JQ3 and didn’t have enough time to transfer due to the delay. We asked them to transfer our luggages directly to our next flight because our next flight is also Jetstar. They told us they couldn’t do that. When we got Sydney airport and rushed to Jetstar counter. They charged us $140 for two luggages. We have traveled so many international flights and always have one free checked bag. We were already late due to your delay and took about 20 minutes to check in and pay luggage fee. Fortunately we did catch our next flight from Sydney to Honolulu. When we arrived Honolulu, we found our two luggages missing. We spent one hour to file the paperwork. On 1/31/2020, we got a call from Portland, Oregon International Airport (PDX) Alaska Airline counter on 1/31/2020. They told us that our bags arrived at PDX and asked us to contact Jetstar and make arrangement to pick up (because Jetstar doesn't have any contract with Alaska Airline to deliver missing bags to customers). We discussed options with Jetstar luggage reps several times and spent over three hours on the phone. Finally, they gave us three options: 1. We can go to PDX and pick up the baggage ourselves. 2. Ask Alaska Airline to make arrangement to deliver the baggage. Alaska told us they could not do so since they don't have contract with Jetstar. 3. Arrange a third-party courier to pick up. Jetstar will reimburse cost with any of above options. After we considered the above three options, we decided to pick up the baggage on our own. We live 70 miles from PDX and it takes us about 1.5 hours one way to PDX. We left home at 5:30pm after work and came back at 9:00pm. We spent three hours on the road and half hour at PDX. We have been working the reimbursement with Jetstar since 2/1/2020. They asked us to complete the statutory declaration. We did.

jetstar airways,Edward Tapley,2020-03-06,"Not Verified |  Melbourne to Sydney. Charged $65 at the gate for being a tiny bit over the 7kg allowance. If this charge was for any other reason other than the obvious, opportunistic revenue gathering, they would also be charging the people whom they deem to be over weight for the extra kg’s they’re carrying. I do not feel this silly $65 charge is at all fair. Plane was then delayed because a tire was worn out and needed changing once we had all boarded. Nice to know they are on top of routine maintenance. Fingers crossed. After spending the last few years in Europe and having taken over 100+ flights on all major and budget of airlines I have to say Jetstar is my least favourite by a long shot.

However the flight got cancelled and apparently the only flight available to rebook him on isn’t until 3:15pm this afternoon with Qantas, meaning he will miss his meeting. This “only flight” available however is a load of lies as there was another Qantas flight available at 9:15 plus multiple virgin flights but apparently it’s impossible to book onto these flights. So I suggested how about I personally book him onto one of these flights, because For some reason they can’t do that, and they pay the difference in price but no, they can’t do that either.  I get that it’s a budget airline but at the very least you would expect them to put them to rebook passengers on time appropriate flights when they are the reason passengers can’t catch their original flights.

I do not live in Brisbane, which means I would have had to either pay to change my connecting flights, or pay for several nights accommodation. Also, it affects my Tokyo accommodation. Due to the frequent changes, I could not gamble on whether Jetstar would stick with the new proposed dates or suddenly switch them again. I understand that flights are set to change, and this is forewarned upon booking but the sheer frequency and drastic shifts are unsettling - especially being so close to the departure dates. I requested a refund, which I was permitted. Then followed up by filing a complaint. The complaint was handled by automated sympathy messages and a declaration that it is not Jetstars responsibility as it is already outlined in the policy. These changes can end up costing travelings severely to change flights, book and rearrange accommodations, and other expenses.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2,2,1,,1,1,3,no
jetstar airways,Alex Warland,2020-02-02,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Sydney to Melbourne - JQ527, then scheduled to fly to Perth on JQ970 two weeks later. SYD - MEL flight was good, and I can't see myself ever paying extra to fly QF or VA for an hour hop. Everything had to be paid for, but honestly, I didn't mind - you close your eyes and you're there. Seats themselves were not very well padded, but that's to be expected. Legroom was ideal, coming from a semi-tall bloke. Bags came out quickly, had an on-time departure and arrival, service was great. That's to be expected, and from someone who had never flown them before, I felt that what everyone always says about them is misguided - it's a budget airline after all. We took the Skybus from St Kilda to Tullamarine - the last of the day @ 8 pm, so we had to wait around the airport for a bit. However, for a $20.50 fare for two adults (special), the convenience and not having to catch public transport was worth it. Check-in at Tullamarine was easy, as was bag drop, went through security, only to find our flight had been cancelled due to the crew timing out (read - legally worked too long that shift to be able to operate the onward flight) - so, back through the terminal and waiting in a line for help. Thank god we got there when we did, because the queue stretched for ages right after we arrived. The good thing is, it's super easy to change your flight when it's cancelled. We originally changed our flight to a 6:05 am departure with Jetstar, but seeing the provided accommodation was in Preston - a good 45mins away by taxi, we tried to get a better flight - also seeing that people had been able to change to Qantas flights. They are constantly loading more flights and options into the system in the event of a cancellation, so we asked to see if there was anything better they could do for us, and it turns out that there was a Virgin flight the next day leaving at 9AM. This suited us, and we were set. The accommodation they provided was great - fairly modern and gave us meal vouchers to use at the hotel - we used them for breakfast, which was okay, but I would use them for dinner depending on when you need to go there if you're in the same situation. They also reimburse you for any taxi services you need to get to and from the airport - however you need to coordinate this yourself after the journey is done. However, the lady coordinating the giving out of hotels at Tullamarine was rude. Too sassy for her own good, we tried making conversation with her and all she could do was give snarky comments back - when she was literally doing her scheduled job (write people's names down on a list), at her normal shift time. We're the ones being delayed here - you're getting paid. Cut the attitude. However, everyone else at the service desk was friendly, which was good. I wouldn't hesitate to fly Jetstar again given my experience on the first flight, but it's also good knowing they have a good system for cancellations - you're covered even if they're unable to fly. And, for paying $150pp incl bag, getting a free hotel, taxi service, and a widebody Virgin flight the next day with inc food and entertainment was great value for money. Thanks for cancelling my second flight, Jetstar. It couldn't have gone better, for me at least :)",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,7,3,4,,,4,5,yes

Queenstown to Auckland. Our experience with Jetstar Airways on a flight in New Zealand was very disappointing due to the disruption in the flight, the subsequent lack of communication, and the promises of staff that were not supported by corporate. Jetstar experienced a countrywide failure in their computer systems causing manual processing leading to delayed flights. Our flight was delayed over 4 hours causing our connection to the US to be missed. There was no later flight, so an overnight stay was required. There was no communication about status - the flight boards were not updated. In fact the board showed that we had arrived, when in fact we hadn't even left. I was not able to pursue changes with the connecting flight airlines because they showed the flight on time.  Upon arrival in Auckland I was informed we would be transported to a hotel and provide meals. Later I was told the transportation would not be provided but we could take the Skybus and submit expenses for reimbursement. I asked if there was more than one hotel for the brand and was told no. When I got to the Skybus counter, I was asked which of the two hotels for that brand. I went back to the ticket counter to get the specific location, and by the time I returned we had missed the bus. Upon arrival in Auckland there was a long (1km) walk to the hotel. Upon checking out the next day we were advised that the hotel was paid, and a $30 credit for meals was applied. The latter in direct conflict with written policy that it should've been $60 and further that the airport representative stated that would not be limited to $60. Upon return to the airport the next day, there was no one available to handle the reimbursement request so we submitted the request for expense reimbursement online ($167). After waiting over a week past the processing timeline I followed up via chat. At which time I was advised that they would not support reimbursement of any kind despite the statement of staff. No avenue for escalation was provided. I accessed their chat complaint system, uploading all of the original documents supporting the reimbursement request. I was on the chat for 2 and ¼ hrs. and asked redundant questions and then to be advised there is no reimbursement. At one point the individual stated there is no reimbursement when in home city, which was blatantly wrong as it was clear my home city is in the US. Thankfully, Jetstar did arrange and pay for the hotel as they obviously acknowledged the need. But the rest of the response was not worthy of your trust and patronage.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,1,3,3,1,,1,1,no

jetstar airways,Richard Vida,2020-01-25,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Hobart. I had booked with confidence as this is a Qantas subsidiary. Arrived at the counter and one has to check in and also tag their own bags. I had no problem once I was able to find a working kiosk and one that was available. The lines were unbelievably long due to most people having no idea how to check in at the kiosk and were dumbfounded with the bag tag. It was mass chaos and no one from JetStar assisting in any way. I had done my research and paid for my extra baggage and carry-ons before arrival. By the time you pay for the extras, believe me, I spent much more than if I just flew Qantas or Virgin. But Jetstar had the flight schedule I needed. Arrived at the gate, weighed my carry-on and the customer service rep tagged my bag. We sat there and sat there. No plane, no announcements. Then about 200 other passengers descended upon our gate. Something was up. No gate agents at the desk. Finally an announcement of a gate change. I move to the new gate. There is a plane. We sit for another 30 minutes, I'm suspect there is a problem as we are scheduled to fly an A321 and an A320 is at the gate, which will not accommodate all the passengers. Suddenly, I watch all of the gate agents pack up and leave. No announcement, nothing. They just walk away and disappear. Again, I get up and walk over to the departures board and see that again we have a new gate. I go back and announce it to those of us sitting at a gate. We all move to the new gate per the board. An announcement was never made of the gate change and passengers were running all over the place, confused, furious - mass chaos. Finally we board. I'm sitting in the first row 1A, extra room seat and I paid the premium for it. I notice that I'm sitting in a wet seat and the carpeting is soaked and squishy. The cabin manager, who is professional, gregarious and superlative in customer service briefs us on operating the emergency exit and then we sit and wait. We sit and we sit. The PA of the plane is not working. The cabin crew notices the water and the wet carpet. Mechanics determine that due to the heavy rains, someone left the door open and the water affected the electrics of the PA system. We sit as they try to fix it. Of course the plane is taken out of service, and our cabin crew is now illegal and we disembark. We gather again in the gate, and remarkably a new plane was promised and delivered. At this point, the gate agents were finally competent and doing their jobs. I have to say I found the cabin crews to be excellent and I felt very safe flying Jet Star. The hassle one experiences at the gate is absurd to say the least. Flying is bad enough on a full service carrier, so why torture yourself with JetStar. The check-in process is ridiculous and something I'll never forget.",Business,Economy Class,2,3,5,3,1,1,1,no

jetstar airways,L Caddy,2020-01-17,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cairns to Perth via Darwin. As a budget subsidiary of Qantas. I was expecting Jetstar to be half decent. Next time I’d rather just pay the extra $100 to go on a Virgin plane and get everything included. With Jetstar, you have to pay for checked baggage and for seat selection and meals which adds to the cost and it somehow ends up being more expensive than Virgin or Qantas. The flight I was on JQ 920, was scheduled to leave Cairns at 0850 and arrive in Darwin at 1125. A Jetstar employee notified customers that the flight was delayed by half an hour. 20 minutes later, the same message was repeated meaning the flight had been delayed by an hour. Then I got a notification on my phone saying that the flight wasn’t going to leave until 1650!! This was bad news for me as I had a connecting flight out of Darwin. I then spoke to both Jetstar and Qantas customer services and they couldn’t put me onto another flight combination (even though there were at least 20 seats on two Qantas planes back home, I googled it). The customer service, in my opinion handled it very poorly and only offered me accommodation in Darwin. I needed to get home urgently for an appointment the next day but they couldn’t care less, no sympathy shown at all.

They have you retrieve your baggage between connection flights and have a super expensive fee for checked baggage! We had a domestic flight from Sapporo to Tokyo and followed by an international flight from Tokyo to Hong Kong with Jetstar. The staff at Sapporo check in counter did not speak a word of English, so when she struggled to tell us that we had to get our luggage and re-check in through their international flight counter in Tokyo, we thought we heard her wrong. Also, they charged us 10,000 yen for 2 luggage bags and measured the dimension of the only carry-on we had.  The domestic flight was late by 30 minutes. Our layover time in Tokyo was supposed to be 1hr 50min. So by the time we got to Tokyo and got our bags, it was already less than an hour before the flight takeoff to Hong Kong. We had to run all the way to their counter and check in our bags again and ran to the gate, just to later on find out the flight to Hong Kong was also delayed. The boarding is always a disaster for them. They have all the passengers lineup for boarding at once and could take almost an hour to finish boarding, no wonder their flight is always late. Staffs were unresponsive and rude.  Due to their delayed flights, we could not have a chance to eat before we got on board, so we wanted to order food off the menu. I tried to call the attendants 3 times that we wanted to order, they kept telling me to wait. My husband said they may only take order with their food trolley which they moved from front to the end cabin. OK! That doesn’t make any sense but alright I will follow their rules and wait, unfortunately we sat at the end of the cabin. So we waited for another hour and the food trolley finally passed by and passed right through us, without stopping and back behind the curtain!! I was like, didn’t I tell them again and again I wanted to order? How could they just ignore us like that? We called one of the attendants back and she goes, “I am sorry, all our food is sold out.” Could anyone tell me what did I miss there? If you want cheap flight, I can tell you this airline isn’t exactly cheap with their high checked baggage cost and extra carry-on cost.

I suggest that anyone thinking of flying Jetstar not bother buying tickets with them and use a different airline.,Business,Economy Class,2,,,,,,1,no
jetstar airways,Jason Hart,2019-12-23,Not Verified | I am a regular traveler that will never use Jetstar again. So they cancelled my flight from Hobart to Melbourne on the 1/12/19. Provided accommodation but would not pay for transportation to and from there accommodation which was a cost of over $120 I was told I could make a claim through Jetstar. The earliest flight the next day they offered was a late afternoon flight which didn’t suit my requirements I booked an early morning flight with Tigerair to get home. So I don’t use there return flight giving them an extra 2 seats on there plane I pay for my return trip out of my own pocket so because I never took their flight that didn’t suit my requirements I’m ineligible to get a refund in my taxi fares. Jetstar will do anything to get out of reimbursements of any kind Jetstar are corporate thieves and I will never use their service again. Unhappy regular traveler.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
jetstar airways,T Adam ,2019-12-23,"Not Verified |  Gold Coast to Sydney. The last 4 flights I have booked with Jetstar have been cancelled. The staff on the ground are never to blame - they are rushing around working hard to try and make up for the fact that Jetstar’s systems are awful, they are understaffed, their facilities and resources are run down, and there is a general lack of organisation across the board with their flights. It honestly seems like they intentionally cancel flights so they can squeeze more people into empty flights, hence saving money. They wait until the last minute to tell you so they can be sure the threshold number of seats that would make the flight profitable is not achieved. When you book a flight with this airline you are buying a “seat” but never actually buying the flight time you think you are. Cancellations and delays will occur, and you will be shuffled around repeatedly by overworked and stressed staff. If they advertised themselves as “you’ll get a seat to your destination when it suits us and is profitable for us and this may mean repeated delays and cancellations” then the consumer would know what they are actually buying. They are not an option for convenience, reliability, good customer service or transparency.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,5,1,1,1,1,no
jetstar airways,B Lennon,2019-12-22,"✅ Trip Verified | Jetstar flights got cancelled between Melbourne and Sydney on Sunday, 22 Dec. Jetstar sent out emails lying to customers that the problem lies with late incoming aircraft. However, the ground staff confirmed that early morning flights were cancelled. Our boarding time was 8.20am and now it is 10.50am. This has happened on multiple occasions. This will most definitely be the last time we make use of Jetstar’s disgusting customer service!

jetstar airways,Karan Mediratta,2019-12-19,Not Verified |  Traveling from Melbourne to Bali. Receive a text at 11:00pm that the flight is canceled. Shocking. Gave an alternative flight which was longer via Sydney. Totally no consideration of your clients. Very unfortunate company. Quite surprised that it is still open.

jetstar airways,R Shaeer,2019-12-13,✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Sunshine Coast. We got in the airport two hours earlier. There was a very crowed long queue with 6 long lines. We waited in the line and walked slowly in front. They mixed all the flights of jetstar together. They announced passengers of other flights two times to go out of queue and stand in separated lines. This way the queue discipline was destroyed and a lot of people jump from end of queue to in front. We waited and waited and there were 3 ladies in counter. As we arrived to one line before last. Two of the ladies left and only one was there to receive the luggage. We waited two long and then ran to catch the flight. Every passenger of jetstar had stress of losing her flight. I have never experience such an unorganized airline in my life.,Family Leisure,Economy Class,3,5,4,4,3,1,3,no

jetstar airways,C Calden,2019-12-12,"✅ Trip Verified |  Christchurch to Auckland. Worst flight experience ever. Both of today's flights were cancelled and I was told I couldn't re-book for 2 days which would have forfeited $1,000's of dollars in plans. To make matters they only offered to refund the price of the ticket without any compensation for the impact on my plans. Instead of cancelling my plans and booking a hotel for 2 nights, I was forced to pay another airline $400 to continue my trip. All of the ticket agents were terrible to deal with indicating they didn't actually work for Jetstar and I'd have to call them for further assistance. After holding for 30 minutes, I hung up and will have to try and resolve after I return from holiday.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,,,,,1,1,no
jetstar airways,Andika Chandra,2019-12-12,"Not Verified |  Was suppose to fly out on a flight from Sydney to Melbourne on Friday  6th December at 8:30pm as it got delayed 3 times due to the smoke coming from the New south Wales bush fires before it was announced cancelled at 11pm. At this stage, I was frustrated an I had called the Jetstar contact center and had explained the situation on which they had re booked me for a flight to Melbourne the next morning with Virgin which I thought was good service. I also had been told that I would be reimbursed for a hotel up to $150 dollars per night from the lady I was on the phone as I and didn't want to take a cab or ride share that would easily cost me over $100 to get back home to go back to my area which is 35kms away from the Airport. I decided to sleep at a hotel nearby which costed me $180 on which I thought I would get reimbursed with $30 for food reimbursements as well but I ended up with nothing as I had to live in a area 50 km away from the airport. If I was told by anyone by Jetstar this whole situation of me forking out more money would of been avoided. Jetstar really needs to improve their communication as it is really just poor and wouldn't recommend anyone to fly with them.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,2,1,,,3,2,no
jetstar airways,SY Goh,2019-12-11,"Not Verified |  Scheduled on flight from Singapore to Bali 8/12/19 at 5.20am. The flight was cancelled at 7pm (10 hours before departure time). We had already done online check in by then and did not realise the flight was cancelled till 2am. The next available flight proposed was 24 hours away on 9/12/19. As we had already made travel plans and tours in Bali, we decided to cancel the booking and were refunded the cost of the flight. However, there was no additional compensation by Jetstar or apology. The new flight booked was three times the cost of the original flight as this was a last minute booking. This is the second time Jetstar has suddenly cancelled a flight. My first experience was from Hobart to Singapore. Will not travel with Jetstar again.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2,3,3,,,2,4,no
jetstar airways,N Beale,2019-12-10,✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Phuket. We paid for the max package We had to change our dates of flight and when booking is part of the max package at no charge. When we change them they charged an extra $400 approximately because apparently fares had gone up but were actually cheaper on their web site. Only extra leg room is the front row. Waste of time.

On the day of the flight I came to do check in and they had cancelled my flight 2 days earlier and didn’t even bother to send me an email. Not to mention the money wasn’t refunded to my credit card. They told me it was cancelled and they process a refund and if I wanted to fly I needed to buy a new ticket. ",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,,,1,1,no
jetstar airways,D Harper,2019-12-08,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gold Coast to Sydney. My flight into Sydney was fairly uneventful with friendly flight staff but on arrival the back of the flight was disembarked via the metal steps onto the tarmac then up 2 flights of steps to exit. I a mother traveling alone with my 1.5 year old and was my self struggling to carry her and my bags on that route but to my dismay i had to watch a elderly couple absolutely struggle to decent the stairs and then ascend the stairs, this occurred in full view of a male staff member watching on. When  I reached the top I alerted a female flight attendant who went to see if someone could help but the struggle had already occurred. I though it was terribly lacking in compassion and frankly dangerous. On my return flight apart from a delay the flight was fine, when i went to pick up my baggage and pram i found it and many bags piled up on the floor and stuck in the re entry point of the baggage claim carousel and was continuing to stack up and bags falling, no staff were there helping or stopping the situation, when i pulled my pram from the wreck its wheel was broken off and is now not usable.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,2,2,1,,,1,1,no
jetstar airways,Paul Simonides,2019-12-08,Not Verified |  Adelaide to Sydney. I've been travelling for years and especially with Jetstar but no more the staff were rude and do nothing to help elderly people. They changed gates 5 minutes to board. I had to push my mum in a wheelchair and was hard as I'm dealing with a hernia. To top it off they cancelled our flight and saying it was an act of God and but at gate 25 they gave our plane away. Jetstar said cancelling our flight was an act of God on Monday night but after speaking to friends in Sydney it wasn't that bad ... Qantas took off 20 minutes before our flight.  All in all Jetstar are definitely not the airline you want to travel with.,Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,,,,,1,1,no
jetstar airways,Victor Hew,2019-12-07,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Melbourne. If there is an award for worse airline in the world, Jetstar has got to top the list. I’ve never never taken any flights that cancels me flight 3 straight weeks in a row, and it’s a last minute cancel, 30 mins before departure. Yesterday’s cancellation (6th dec 2019) is the last straw. We were all embarked on the plane, 5 minutes later we were asked to disembark and flight was cancelled. Jetstar is the most unreliable airline I’ve taken.  For example yesterday’s flight cancellation reason was due to Sydney airport curfew, but it’s because they delayed their own schedule that went into airport curfew time which is unacceptable! On top of that, no compensation arrangements at all! No accountability! And  lousy customer service. Look at the line to the support counter in the picture I attached.

jetstar airways,Ian Fleming,2019-12-06,"✅ Trip Verified |  Newcastle to Melbourne. Booked a return flight for my wife and my self to visit our son and family in Melbourne. Our flight was due to depart at 6.10am. We were informed at 8.30pm the night before that the flight had been cancelled due to operational problems, whatever that means. Tried to rebook on any flight that day but was informed all seats had been booked. The only flight available was the next day at the same time. One day lost as we were not allowed to rebook our return flight a day later. Friends laughed when I told them we had booked with Jetstar as this appears to be a regular occurrence with this airline. Jetstar may be cheap but I doubt if we will fly with them, again.

jetstar airways,J Ryd,2019-12-03,"Not Verified |  Queenstown to Sydney. My flight was delayed 3.5 hours but that was not the issue. Its the fact that they then lost the baggage of 15 people and did not tell anyone. Once I arrived in Sydney I waited for my bag in baggage claim for about 30 minutes until I went over to a desk to ask about it. Apparently many bags did not make the flight. This does not make much sense because they had my bag more than 4 hours before take-off and there was only 1 other international flight at that time. They also did not inform anyone else via email or anything until we went to ask about it. They promise 24 hour delivery of lost baggage but that is completely false. They also said they would send me an email with all of the information which was also false. And finally, they provided a baggage tracking site that does not work at all. I had to call them to get my reference number so that I could check, but when I enter my information, surprisingly the site that looks like it's from 2002 does not work.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,no
