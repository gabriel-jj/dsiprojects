sriwijaya air,R Borsok,2020-03-22,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolute disaster. First after buying e-ticket I didnt received any confirmation or e-ticket. After few emails they send me my ticket. On the airport when my luggage was on the way to airplane some woman behind counter told her colleague that we can not fly to Sorong. No closer explanation and send us away. We came to Sriwinaya office on the airport. Again no closer explanation. She just showed me picture in her phone in Indonesian language. When I translated it by my self I found out Sorong airport is closed. They asked me if I want refund but when I told them: Ok make a refund she told me oh sorry I dont know how. You have to send email. So I send email but answer was ""You have to call us if you want cancel flight. So I called them 5 times. In last call they told me there will be 30 USD fee for transaction and also 15% fee for cancellation. Transaction time is 2-3 months. So I asked for some credit or maybe change date of flights but there is no other option. 15% fee and 30 USD fee is only option.

I don't want to know how much it is when I am paying at the airport .. already cancelled the second flight with them and booked a flight with AirAsia. This was cheaper than to pay extra luggage.

sriwijaya air,Jason Smart,2018-11-24,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a flight with Sriwijaya for a 10.30am departure from Jakarta to Pontianak. I turn up at the airport at 9am, check in and then hang around. Then I notice that the flight is not actually due to depart until 11am. It was always an 11am departure and their website had got it wrong when it stated 10.30. But leaving at 11 would still get me Pontianak at 12.25. A bit tight for my meeting, but doable. So while I waited, I checked out some stats for the flight I was about to take. Over the last ten days, almost every flight was delayed. Sometimes by up to two hours. This concerned me and so I checked the whereabouts of the incoming flight. It was presently flying from Malang to Jakarta. And it was on time. So no delays. And then it lands and I’m very happy. So I wait and wait and there are lots of announcements in Indonesian (I’m a Brit) which I couldn’t understand. But I could tell my fellow passengers were a bit annoyed and so I went up to the desk. ‘I’m sorry, sir,’ said the young lady. ‘Two hour delay.’ ‘Why?’ ‘Operational reason.’ So that was that. Meeting cancelled and I didn’t bother taking the flight. When I went back to get a refund for their misery making, I received the final sting on Sriwijaya Air’s tail: instead of a full refund of 1.4 million rupiah, they gave me 541,00. Lesson learned: I should have flown Garuda rather than chancing it with these jokers. Never again.",Business,Economy Class,1,,,,,3,1,no

I arrived at 5.00pm for my 6.40pm flight and was shocked to see it rescheduled for 9.15pm. When I spoke to the CS, they informed me that they had ""just"" got the information and that is the reason why nobody was informed. They directed me to their ticket office to air my complaint. There were 2 young women in there, I proceeded to ask one of them if there was an earlier flight, she said she would check and walked out. The other one quietly informed me that there was no other flight. The other one came back (as though she had consulted someone) and said she checked and there were no more flights.  I then left to check in and was shocked that the BP said boarding time was 8.45pm, meaning they had known long enough to print it out on the BP. My checks revealed the plane had not been on time for the past 3 weeks. Very disappointed with the horrible service and lack of empathy. ",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,,,,,1,1,no

I was supposed to get reimbursement for my flight back in July and had to provide all my bank information to the company's customer service department so that this would be done quickly (after having to call them in person for 2-3 weeks since they wouldnt pick up a single phone call for a while).

The transit was supposed to be 8.5 hours over night so we booked a transit hotel in Makassar with free cancellation until one day before. Today when we arrived at the airport we were told that our flight to Makassar had been cancelled already weeks ago and that we can take another flight 5 hours later. They insisted that they had informed us via SMS but it never arrived, other tourist had exactly the same problem. I showed them my phone for proof, still the only thing they offered was refunding the ticket so we can book with another airline. This didn’t make sense because all other options did not save us much time (especially with the luggage check-through) and were more expensive. I expected them to at least refund our hotel that we could not cancel anymore (in Europe you even get money if you have no damage claims and a delay; just for the inconvenience). They also called me but only short beforehand with an unknown number, when I tried to call back, nobody answered. In the end all we got was an indifferent apology and two boxes of plane food. Oh and the flight we got in exchange was also delayed for one hour - this time I got an SMS. Thank you Sriwijaya Air, never again.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,1,3,3,,,1,1,no

As I live in the US, this is obviously a problem. No explanation why they can't just refund my credit card like a normal company.

When the time arrived the ground crew shouted over and over again, telling people to hurry. What terrible customer service! The food was only one tiny horrible bread and mineral water. The plane was dirty, the seat pockets were filthy as well as the floor. Baggage claim was delayed because of the slow ground crew.

There are other airlines with better amenities flying the same route, but Sriwijaya is one of the few who is doing the direct flight. The worst gripe is that some of the flight attendants are really not professional. The flight attendants generally is bugging the passengers to buy from the inflight shop, which costs lots of money. One of them even sit beside the passenger to ask the passenger to buy the item. While the passenger is also on fault for not rejecting this behavior, the actions of the FAs are not professional at all. The food is not good. The seats are pretty standard in Indonesia.

I was required to fly from Bandung to Yogyakarta, but as an aviation geek, of course I wanted to fly the longest and farthest. I found that an early flight to Tanjung Karang from Bandung is possible to be connected with Sriwijaya Air's flight to Yogyakarta. So I booked it. How was my flight? Departure time was 15.20 LT. But when I arrived at 13.20 LT to secure my favorite seat (emergency exit, window), I was told that there would be a delay. I was expected to fly at 17.00 LT. I didn't mind, especially as beside me, there were 150+ passengers of Lion Air who were supposed to fly at 08.00 LT to Jakarta but still stranded at the airport. A 1 hour 40 minutes of delay for me was fine. Check in went smoothly. I got my favorite seat. The ground crew gave me snacks for the delay compensation. I boarded first. The flight went okay. The food was nice (a cup of water and a slice of cheese bun). Getting my baggage was another story. The conveyor belt was merged with NAM Air's flight from Jakarta.

However when I arrived at the check in counter at Denpasar Bali Airport they told me the flight had 1.5 hour delay. I thought OK not too bad as my international flight that I was supposed to get from Jakarta to Istanbul will be at 8.30 pm so even if the time will be tight I could still make it if I arrive in Jakarta at 7 pm. However the flight then had two hours delay at the end and left Bali airport around 7 pm. Obviously I lost my connection to Istanbul from Jakarta.  I went straight to the customer service of Sriwijaya airport based at Jakarta airport and they gave me no apologies regarding this matter - no compensation, no help to get me a hotel to stay overnight in order to take another plane to get me back to Europe the next day. They simply said they cannot do anything about it. I can understand 30 minutes or one hour delay but two hours is a bit too much and such a bad customer service I have never experienced in my whole life and I travelled a lot.

With an hour flight, I got a tango snack and a cup of mineral water. The seat was good, and the airplane little bit hot at that time. My main criticism is to their cabin crew, which is not quite friendly enough. One of the staff doing the safety demonstration did not have any smile or attract any attention from the passengers.

sriwijaya air,J Navitka,2015-12-21,"I had a flight to Jakarta that arrived at the airport at 12am, so I intended to wait until my 6:40am departure flight at the airport. When I arrived at the terminal I wasn't allowed to enter yet to check my bag, so I spent the night outside the terminal. The update beside my flight never said 'gate open' or 'now boarding' as some of the others did, so finally at 6:00am I went into the terminal, where I was told my flight was not going to the city (Malang) I had paid for because their airport was closed, so I'd be taken to Surubaya instead. Because there was no update outside I didn't even have time to ask questions as the check in clerk took my bag and told me to run because boarding had already started. I just made my flight (ironic since I'd been at the airport for almost 6 hours at this point). Once onboard, there was no mention of the new destination or what was going to be done for passengers. As I de-planed, I asked the stewardesses, who told me I simply needed to find my way to Malang myself. I paid for a flight to a city, you gave me no warning  that I would not arrive there, and then you tell me 'too bad, figure it out?' After I collected my bag (which had tags to Malang by the way), I found the Sriwijaya office and asked the man working there what the airline was going to do for me. His limited English made it a problem to communicate, but essentially he said the same thing as the stewardesses. When I approached him again to ask if he could at least tell me how to get to Malang, he couldn't help me. Thank goodness for another traveller that was in the same boat as me - he 'took me under his wing' and helped me get on a shuttle to the bus terminal (one hour), then through the madness at the terminal and onto the bus for Malang (2.5 hrs), and then to a taxi to my hotel (20 mins). Meaning that not only did I receive no notification that my flight had been changed, no assistance in reaching my actual destination, but it added almost 4 hours to my already 20 hour long commute from the Philippines.

You might need assistance from staff (eg families with young children, elderly people). We arrived at the (domestic) check-in 35 mins prior to departure, struggling with bags and two toddlers. We eventually got the attention of one of the ground staff, who told us we were too late (official policy is you should arrive 45 mins prior) and had missed the flight. Then he walked off and just left us. No help rescheduling to another flight, etc. Thankfully there is now a lot of competition in the low budget airline industry in Indonesia, so shop around.

We were then told the check-in staff must be wrong and ""you should never check the information boards"" (which still read delayed until 10.00). The management staff refused to look at the boards and eventually blamed the airport authorities. No announcements were made or efforts to find us despite us sitting in the only cafe inside the terminal. The attitude from the staff was really poor and they were totally unhelpful. Their only suggestion was to book another flight with the airline - which was 12 hours later and we would have to pay again. No refund or further help was offered and the staff would walk away after shouting at us and then return unable to have a sensible conversation. We submitted a complaint since arriving home - I would advise avoiding this airline if possible as there are plenty of other domestic Indonesian airlines that are fair and Sriwijaya really let us down. A really disappointing experience.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,,,1,1,no
sriwijaya air,D Olsson,2015-09-08,"Denpasar to Dili with Sriwijaya Air, and mostly okay. Check-in in Bali was a bit disorganised but once I got to the front of the line, I was dealt with quickly. Inflight staff were generally good and professional, speaking Indonesian and English. The only problem being their aggressive promotion of duty free goods, including leaning across me for long periods while their scarfs fell all over the place. Also offsetting the service was the worst inflight meal I've ever had. I think it was a battered fish fillet but it was so tough it could also have been chicken. It came with cold fries and some tinned vegetables that were the best part of the meal. Doesn't matter, it was a short flight. With fairly new aircraft and good staff, Sriwijaya Air probably one of the best Indonesian regional airlines.",Business,Economy Class,6,3,4,1,,3,3,yes
sriwijaya air,Inna Nangoi,2015-09-07,"Sriwijaya Air flight from Denpasar to Jakarta. Took about 40 mins delay for the plane take off. We could see some maintenance staff going inside the pilot cabin but none informed about what was happening. While we wait inside the plane was very hot, even after asking the flight attendant to lower the temperature. They offered a pack with bread and water.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,5,3,2,3,,2,4,no

sriwijaya air,Eka Leony,2014-12-18,JOG-CGK with 737-300 SJ231. Delayed about 20 min due to military training above JOG. The flight itself quite smooth with excellent crews and well-maintained aircraft. Additionally they also done a very smooth landing. Surely recommend this airline.,,Economy Class,9,,,,,,5,yes
sriwijaya air,Fitriansyah Yudha,2014-07-29,PLM-CGK with Boeing 737-500. The flight was on time. Good ticket prices. No IFE but it was fair enough for a 50 minute flight. They provided a bread and a cup of mineral water during flight. The cabin staff were friendly enough.,,Economy Class,7,3,3,3,1,,5,yes
sriwijaya air,H Bama,2014-04-06,Went from DPS to DIL with old Boeing 737. My tray table lock was barely functional and scotch tape was all over it. Other than that everything met the standard and surprisingly the food was not disappointing at all.,,Economy Class,7,,,,,,3,yes
sriwijaya air,D Olsson,2014-03-10,I often fly Dili-Denpasar. In comparison to Merpati the big thing is that they have newer more comfortable aircraft's. Otherwise they seem the same as Merpati: frequent delays (allow a lot of time if you're connecting through Bali) poor ground staff and co-ordination ok in-flight service and meals.,,Economy Class,5,,,,,,3,no
sriwijaya air,H Phillips,2013-08-22,Flew CGK-SIN with Sriwijaya Air to make a change from the usual Lion Air Air Asia etc. Booked online only 48 hours before for the bargain price of 40 USD one-way. Check-in was fine with no queue and was lucky to get a retro boarding pass from a dot-matrix printer. We left 45 mins late but they apologised profusely Only about 20 passengers on the flight however the cabin crew told me the return flight from SIN was full. Aircraft was a Boeing 737-300 in surprisingly good condition and the captain was Australian. The only disappointment was the food - a strange combination of scrambled egg half frozen French fries and carrots. However it was still edible and at least food is free unlike the LCCs. I'd use Sriwijaya Air again.,,Economy Class,7,4,5,5,3,,5,yes
sriwijaya air,Bayu Muhardika,2013-06-19,Flight SJ099 from TKG-CGK was planned at 16.40 local time. Then my wife received short message informing that the flight will be delayed to 17.15 without any reason. We arrived on the TKG airport at 16.15 and my wife checked-in. The staff at check-in counter informing again that the flight will be delayed to 17.40. My wife then waited at the lounge and another announcement sounded another delayed flight for SJ099 to 18.40. The delay was going through 19.15 when my wife was finally boarding. The good thing was they informed about the delay the worst thing was the delay itself.,,Economy Class,,3,2,2,1,,1,no
