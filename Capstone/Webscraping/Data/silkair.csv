silkair,R Ward,2020-04-02,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hiroshima to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. This is a review of a flight that was cancelled due to COVID-19. At first they changed the departure airport to FUK. This was unacceptable since it is a long was from HIJ. So I asked them for a full refund for all flights. Despite what must have been an incredibly busy and stressful time for them and their staff, they responded promptly and courteously to all communications, including calling me in Japan from Singapore. The refunds were duly processed with no debate as to whether the change from HIJ to FUK was reasonable or not. Well done to them for their excellent service under trying circumstances for everyone. Put the service of some other airlines to shame. And, guess what, when this is all over and we can start flying again, this is an airline I will definitely think highly of - even though I never got on their plane.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,10,,,,,,5,yes
silkair,Larry Reed,2020-03-27,"✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Yangon. On-time departure from Changi terminal 2. The economy cabin felt clean and the crew were friendly. My expectation was for a basic and efficient service which was we got. This was an evening flight so we had a basic dinner which was okay, as good if not better than the Premium Economy meal from Melbourne to Singapore. Same wine Sauvignon Blanc. This time no other option so I opted for the red. Comfortable, good service, no complaints.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,10,4,5,3,4,1,5,yes

silkair,S Gan,2020-02-29,"✅ Trip Verified |  Am supposed to be on a flight on MI346 from Singapore to Penang on 28 Feb 20, 7.55am. After waiting for 30 minutes, was updated that plane is waiting for the engineering crew to check on some system fault, though it is not a risk for flight. The crew then served us some snacks to appease some of the angry customers and as I bite into the Old Chang Kee curry puff, the cover was already soggy and very nasty for consumption! At about 9.50am they told us that the system cannot be rectified and got us to another plane at gate E6 which is all the way to the other side of the airport. The flight is now delayed to depart at 10.45am. A good 3 hours has been wasted and thus affected my medical appointment. I do not recommend using Silkair, just go for other budget airlines, it just doe not worth the money paying premium and yet getting such lousy service!",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2,3,2,1,1,2,2,no
silkair,Cornelius Florin,2020-02-25,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Davao. Pretty decent flight with a very well organized crew! Happy to serve and with a smile from crew members. The style of the seats is a bit old fashioned (color of the seats). There is no entertainment on the plane but you can connect to the WiFi and get the movies on your device, but only if you have the SilkAir app! Silk air should let us know in advance before you get a 5:30h flight.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,9,3,5,5,1,4,4,yes
silkair,A Thalsha,2020-02-02,"Singapore to Kathmandu. The seat was so dirty and cover was stained. The food I was given was Rice and potato. No veggies no meat no fruits. Is it because Nepal is poor country? Also, no internet and no video surfing in the flight. Worst experience in my life.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,2,1,1,3,1,no
silkair,G Marden,2020-01-11,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Cairns. I would not recommend this airline. What a disappointment considering they are affiliated to Singapore Airlines which are great. Firstly the seating feels the way it looks. Must be the worst looking interior, old badly maintained (seat pockets were broken on both flights), the seats were super uncomfortable, the food was terrible and the flights were late on both occasions. Silk Air will not see me again.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,2,1,1,2,2,no
silkair,Elaine Loh,2019-12-04,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. SilkAir flight departed late due to late arrival of incoming flight. When it was time to board, a hoard of people rushed to the gate. The announcement said business class and gold members first but the hoard was clearly neither. Staff did not bother to enforce the boarding process and didn’t even check the boarding passes of most passengers. Boarding of SilkAir is like a bogan fest of people without manners. On board, the seats are old. My seat has basically outworn it’s upholstery. The toilet is tiny and disgusting. Even upon boarding, the toilet smelled like it was full of stale pee. In flight, the plane was blowing hot air until the plane had enough altitude. One drink service of coffee, tea or juice. Overall, SilkAir is shockingly bad. I am glad to hear Singapore Airlines replacing SilkAir.",Business,Economy Class,3,2,4,,,5,3,no
silkair,Devinder Sran,2019-12-03,"Not Verified |  Brisbane to Singapore via Cairns. Short staffed, so poor food service, seats and plane was worn-out with major wear and tear. Small plane need to use own phone for in flight entertainment for 6.5 hour flight with nowhere to charge your phone. I wouldn't even give 1* for this flight. It's better to book flight with no stopover in regional areas even if I have to pay $300 extra. It's not worth it.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,no
silkair,Kah Kay Au,2019-11-28,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Penang. For this short one hour flight to Penang, Silkair uses the A320 in a 3x3 configuration in economy, SilkAir is the regional branch of Singapore Airlines. A snack of curry puff and a drink was served on this flight. I had the exit row so the leg room was generous. There is no inflight entertainment. You have to download the Silkair Studio app and stream videos and music on your mobile device. So remember to bring along your earphones if you want to use the IFE. Do not expect too much on short regional flights on SilkAir and you will not be disappointed.",Business,Economy Class,6,3,3,2,,3,3,yes
silkair,A Gray,2019-11-25,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chengdu to Singapore. Absolutely the worst business class seat I have  experienced. The width of the 2x2 first 3 rows is acceptable, but the legroom is absolutely appalling - less even than I would expect in a normal premium economy seat. Plus limited recline, circa 30 degrees from vertical, upon which when the person in the seat in front of you is reclined you have even less space to maneuver in and out and are pretty much forced to recline yourself to retain a semblance of spacing. Added to which the seat controls for recline, footrest, lumber massage are really stiff mechanical levers. For a brand new plane absolutely abysmal! There is  no in flight entertainment in the seat backs. In business one is issued with an iPad which can stream movies etc. through the Silk Air WiFi. This does not support Internet connectivity, only the IFE. If you want to use your own device you need to have previously installed the Silk Air app from the app store - something nobody tells you before you board. In the cramped seat space there is very little place to put the iPad, even on the little plastic prop available on request, so one ends up holding it whilst also trying to juggle a meal or whatever. No noise cancelling headphones, just cheap in-ear buds, so I plugged my own noise cancellers in to the iPad. No capability to connect via Bluetooth of course. I found it impossible to doze on the 4.5 hours midnight flight so tried to pass the time with the limited selection of English language films on the iPad. Literally the only redeeming feature of the whole miserable experience was the cabin crew who try their best to give high quality and attentive service. I feel sorry for them having to pretend that they represent a proper business class operation, which this manifestly is not.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,4,1,5,3,1,4,3,no
silkair,R Dalton,2019-11-06,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Cairns. Best descent and landing, however this does not detract from awful experience. 6 hours with no inflight entertainment, cramped seating, appalling food and limited access to facilities which when needed where very unhygienic and unpleasant to use. It was an incredible disappointment having booked with Singapore Airlines to ensure a quality flight from the UK - this truly spoilt it. I would advise folks to avoid this route",Family Leisure,Economy Class,3,1,2,1,,2,2,no
silkair,Elaine Loh,2019-10-23,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. The boarding time stated was 1.30pm but after accumulating nearly a full plane load of passengers in the queue, a change of gate was announced at 1.50pm. We boarded late, which ended up in a late departure. On board, the seats were acceptable with good recline. However, we were on board with a huge group of Chinese tourists, they reclined seats before take off, get up to go to the toilets whilst the plane is taking off, stood up and got their bags before the plane stopped. Cabin crew tried their best to control the mayhem but simply gave up towards the end of the ride. The ride was uncomfortable and felt dangerous due to safety violations of passengers. Although many things are out of SilkAir’s control, I think it would be good if SilkAir gives proper training to the air stewardesses who make announcements. We can never really understand what they are saying because they either fake an American accent but do it so badly that their words are all jumbled up and unclear.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,5,3,3,,,4,2,no
silkair,Elaine Loh,2019-10-20,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. Boeing 737s are always a bad plane to board, so this wasn’t comfortable but this is the same for every 737 flight. Boarding was very strange. We were asked taken to board via bus - but oh my, how we were packed in. Flight was not really comfortable as the plane did not cool down enough. Drink service only - coffee, tea, juice or water. Good that it is such a short flight though.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,6,3,4,,,5,4,yes
silkair,E Beale,2019-10-12,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cochin to Singapore. The positive is that we left and arrived in good time. However the price does not justify what you actually get. Premium price, very old plane with no personal screens. Note you can download their app to watch a variety. The food was dreadful. Served at something like midnight, I opened the foil and recoiled. It was that bad. Fortunately I kept dropping off to sleep which helped the flight pass faster. Overall if I was choosing this route in future I would just go with the cheapest option as SilkAir is really very ordinary.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,4,2,2,1,1,2,1,no
silkair,Jay Kim,2019-08-16,✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. Terrible. It delays all the time as normal LCCs do. They tend to being a little better than the other LCC but it has nothing different. No one apologize for the inconvenience caused by the flight. I don't know why I should take this LCC though I purchase ticket from Singapore Airline all the time. There is significant difference between the two brand and it causes obvious minus for the customers paid premium. Please don't use the poor option because of cheap cost.,Business,Economy Class,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,no
silkair,R Bahamit,2019-05-19,"✅ Trip Verified |  Manado to Singapore with SilkAir in October 2018. Singapore Airlines may be the best airline in the world but its customer service is surely the worst! I called the customer service on 2 different occasions. In both occasions, it was not long until a representative picked up the call, but soon after I shared my enquiries, I was asked to wait for unreasonably long. And while waiting, I was put on hold. In the first occasion, I was put on hold for 46 minutes. Today, I was put on hold for 22 minutes when the whole call was 27 minutes! I wonder what took them so long to find my reservation. Lesson: Never ever call the SIA Customer Service. You may have saved some time by going to their office instead. I have done it a few times. The SIA office is far more efficient than the customer service line.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,3,1,1,1,,1,2,no
silkair,Kah Kay Au,2019-05-18,"✅ Trip Verified |  SilkAir is a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines. It recently started a 4-weekly service to Busan, South Korea. The outbound flight is a red eye flight which arrived early the next morning. As it was a late night flight, only drinks and snacks were served after take off. A simple breakfast was served before arriving into Busan. There is no personal inflight entertainment system on the B737-800. Instead, passengers have to stream movies and music over their personal devices via the SilkAir Studio app. The problem is that if you do not have earphones, you won’t be able to listen to the soundtrack. There is an overhead TV screen showing Korean comedy series. Nobody was paying attention to the TV as most passengers were asleep. I was seated in the exit row so the leg space was generous. However, the same cannot be said of the other rows. Being a service to Korea, there was a Korean flight attendant among the 4 serving the economy cabin. They were pleasant and efficient but somehow lacked the finesse of their counterparts in Singapore Airlines. SilkAir will be absorbed into its parent company Singapore Airlines in due course. It is in need of a re-branding and overhaul to its cabin product.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,6,4,4,3,1,3,3,yes
silkair,Patricia Carvalho,2019-05-14,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the worst experience with SilkAir flying from Singapore to Dili-Timor. Not only my suitcase was delayed for one week, as they initially refused to take responsibility and pay any kind of expense. Silkair's representation in Dili did not contact me once with information on the location of the baggage. After more than one month of discussing this issue with costumer service, I was offered the compensation of 75 dollars as a token of apology for spending a week in Dili without suitcase on a business trip.

silkair,P Gandijaya,2019-03-18,"✅ Trip Verified |  Surabaya to Singapore. Bad airline, bad punctuality, not worth the price. Silkair has always prided themselves to be able to get the passengers to the destination on time. However after multiple times of boarding their flights, paying top dollars compared to other airlines,  this airline is not worth the money. Cabin is at most average. It is clean, but it is not exquisite. Service is standard. But the biggest disappointment has always that they are late.",Business,Economy Class,2,1,1,3,,1,1,no

silkair,L Cooper,2019-01-28,"✅ Trip Verified | Flight was delayed initially from 9.15pm to 9.45pm, then became 10.15pm. No water or snacks given for the delay, only apologies. I chose Silk Air expecting to be punctual whilst other budget airlines serving Singapore to Penang route all boarded on time. Such a disappointment. Seat was ok and good enough for a  short flight. SilkAir has no personal IFE. Cabin crews were not bad. Food is terrible, only a wrap with fruits (the real fruits are only 3 slices of watermelon while oranges are sweetened can ones).

silkair,L Xu,2019-01-28,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Wuhan. In general the service is satisfied. However, I can't agree that it's value of money. The price level of SilkAir is almost as its parent company Singapore Airline, but the cabin service is too far away from what its price suggests. I ordered noodle in this flight and the taste was plain. The only memorable thing was they do serve ice-cream. And the seat space was as narrow as budget airline.

We boarded efficiently and the aircraft left on time. Not so slick as their parent company Singapore Air, and the cabin felt old and basic however it was fine for a short flight. The refresher towels were cold and in a pack. We were given a meal, it was not very nice but that wasn’t important.

silkair,T Yee,2018-11-25,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Kota Kinabalu. Early morning departure flight from Singapore, flight crew were on their first leg and looked fresh and cheerful. Going out on the Boeing 737-800 and the flight was half empty, hence was lucky enough to have the side seats free which no doubt contributed to the overall sense of luxury. SilkAir B737's are decked out in an airy, light decor but the seats are a little bit spartan, with only the drop-down table and a large expanse of plastic moulding, which allows you to store any loose items you wish (and no doubt, forget about them when you depart). Legroom is adequate, if nothing to write home about, but certainly bit better than budget airlines, while the B737 is always a more width constrained than the A320. Pre flight service included face towels (disposable packets) and offers of newspapers. Despite a half full flight, they had run out of meal choices by the time they reached me, but small matter, the food was never going to be the reason to fly, anyway. Entertainment was via SilkAir Studio - bring your own electronic device, and stream via wifi. I was slightly amused to see that the music choices hadn't changed at all in the last 6 months, though I would guess that the movie options must have changed. The biggest downside is the limited toilet capacity at the rear - small, cramped, and if you are on a full flight, there will be endless queues. Not so on this flight, though, and we landed on time, uneventfully.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,7,3,4,3,3,4,3,yes
silkair,Ralph Jones,2018-10-27,"✅ Trip Verified |  Penang to Singapore. A nice regional airline that shares the relative same standards or at least approach as its big sister, Singapore airlines.

For only one hour and a half flight (short haul flight), I must admit that I was really impressed about the very good service on board. We had two complete menus to choose and many kind of drinks for free. Enough space between the seats and the stewardesses was really friendly. Unlike for flights within Europe, I am no more used to that. We usually get at least a small sandwich or snack. By low cost airline, we need to pay extra if we want to get something to drink or eat.

The check in at Colombo was extremely pleasant and the agent went above and beyond to ensure I had the seats I wanted, however this was the end of anything good about Silk Air. I found the crew to be robotic, unfriendly and rude. Meal service is mediocre.  The worst part about Silk Air is that there is no entertainment, besides the app. Silk Air has disappointed me in the past but this trip with them is my final one. The cabin ambiance is depressing and they need to step up their game.",Business,Economy Class,3,3,2,2,1,5,2,no
silkair,Y Han,2018-07-25,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Kota Kinabalu, my first experience of the SilkAir B737-800 product. Boarding was by zone number, and uncomplicated. I had the luxury of an empty seat next to me, so that made a difference when I took my seat. First impression was of fairly simple but clean-looking cabin environment. Seat backs were sculpted plastic and very basic, with only the tray table and a deep plastic pocket to lose your belongings in. The B737 always strikes me as a rather more cramped cabin than the A320; and so it turned out when checking Seatguru, with 1 inch less pitch and seat width than the A320. We were given cool towelettes and offered newspapers before takeoff, and a hot meal appeared (chicken spaghetti, which proved a bit difficult to eat for obvious reasons). Entertainment is available by the SilkAir Studio, and the choice of music proved disappointingly poor, although more movies appeared available. Service was generally friendly and efficient, and we landed feeling at least half human.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,7,3,4,4,3,4,3,yes

Then we got on the plane and there was no onboard entertainment. Let me clarify. There were a couple of screens throughout the plane with Asian entertainment. No headsets were offered. The cabin crew were not accommodating and when asked for a drink (Diet Coke) I was made to feel like this was an imposition. Further to this they returned with a cup. Not even a can. The first offer of a drink other than an orange juice or water was at least 4 hours into the flight. I would not recommend this airline.

The food is palatable but insufficient and nothing exceptional. Aircraft mainainance is practically non existent. There is no inflight entertainment except that you can purchase the Silk Air studio app and watch a limited range of a fairly pathetic selection of movies. The flight crew however are very friendly and can be chatted with easily. In short, Silk Air should not charge its premium fare because it is practically a budget airline with free meals and marginally better legroom.

silkair,Winlynn Choo,2018-05-20,"✅ Trip Verified |  Penang to Singapore. I was arriving to Singapore on the delayed MI349 on last Saturday (12-May-2018). I always trust SIA would handle my baggage properly as compared to other airlines. While getting my luggage covered with luggage cover, and with my trust with SIA companies, I did not check my baggage when I was still inside the airport. I took a Grab home, took my dinner before I was to unpack my stuffs. I got terribly shocked to look at how my luggage was broken. When I opened the cover, it is all cracked inside from the adjustable handler until down 30% of my luggage. I did not place much stuffs inside my luggage, but spare luggage and clothes.  I contacted the customer service through the online form provided on the same night, and followed up again on 16-May-2018 (Wednesday), no news from SilkAir at all! I have tried to call SilkAir, but keep getting the wrong information online. It is one week since I last arrived and complained now. Still no sign of following up.

silkair,H Kang,2018-05-06,"✅ Trip Verified |  Penang to Singapore. So disappointed for Silkair, as it's slogan ""Joy to fly"", but I do not agree to that. This is mainly because the cabin crew are not nice, it doesn't deserve as a best regional airline. Penang is one of the most important route for Silkair, however, the ground service only open 2 hours before the fight, the staff open the counter 10mins later and the staff work slowly, I am Silver elite for Singapore Airline and already web check in, but the staff use more than 10 mins to handle my luggage and give me the passport.

I ordered the meals from “All-time favorite” menu in advance and are very satisfied with quality and quantity on both flight. Toilet are kept clean and dry at all time and I believe that it was clean after every usage. Lounge in Manado has changed to Concordia lounge which is fantastic comparing to Bunaken lounge in my previous journey. Outgoing flight show quiet comedy on the screen, while the returning flight provide iPad to everyone as they want to keep cabin dark for passengers who choose to sleep. Some negative point is that seat in the 737 seemed to have less seat pitch, less recline and less comfortable than their A320 fleet, and the aircraft of my returning flight is not properly cleaned.

To be honest I would fly Thai Airlways via BKK. It might be longer in terms of time, however it’s far more comfortable than being crammed into Silk Air. 5 hours on Silk Air passes very slowly indeed.

silkair,H Cai,2018-03-14,"✅ Trip Verified |  Took the 7.55pm flight Singapore to Kuala Lumpur on 7 March. The gate was changed less than an hour from the departure time. There was no one at the initial gate to re-direct the passengers. Only an announcement over the PA system which could have easily been missed. Later, we were informed that there had been a change in plane, therefore change in gate. At the new gate, a plane awaits us. We boarded the plane at the original boarding time. Upon boarding, it was instantaneous that one could feel the air con in the aircraft wasn't working. The entire plane was stuffy. With that poor ventilation and stuffiness, the airline should not have allowed passengers to board. The ordeal begins thereafter, and an entire plane of passengers were left in the stuffy aircraft for the next 3+ hours. In between, a passenger who wasn't feeling well was escorted out. Remaining passengers were left fanning themselves furiously. Though the pilot had the aircon restarted twice, it was obvious that was not in a state good enough to keep the aircraft less stuffy. Air stewardess and stewards could only keep serving iced water and refreshing towels. It was a pathetic state. When asked, the air stewards and stewardess looked clueless on what's going on. After a couple of tries and taxi-ing off from the gate, the pilot and engineers realised that it is not going to work. We were told that they will change a plane at close to 11pm. The next plane was scheduled to depart at 11.30pm. There were further delays to the 11.30pm. First they told us it's 5 minutes delay and we will be allowed to board at 11.35pm. But that was not the end of it. We finally begin boarding only at close to 12am. After we got off the aircraft with the faulty aircon, we were given a pack with pathetic food. Just before we board the replacement flight, we were given a slip of paper telling us that there is free wifi at the airport and we can notify our friends and family of the delay if they are waiting for us at KLIA. Thanks but no thanks. Already too late. Just when we are boarding and we are required to switch of our phones? Brainless move. Good job SilkAir, and good luck.

silkair,V Wasathan,2018-01-30,✅ Trip Verified |  Cairns to Singapore. This was a long and tiring flight on a Boeing 737. SilkAir tries to make the best of a bad situation but the sad truth is that a 7 hour flight requires flat bed seats in Business class and that can be accomplished only in a bigger aircraft like a 777. The seats do not recline enough to withstand a 7 hour flight. The lounge at Cairns is compact but sufficient. The in flight attendants were good but were again stymied by the limitations of the aircraft. There is very limited in flight entertainment. SilkAir must either operate the 777 on this segment or simply hand over this route to Singapore Airlines.,Solo Leisure,Business Class,4,1,3,3,2,3,2,no

No seatback IFE, instead you logged into the aircraft WiFi (no internet) to download an Android APK for their Studio app. Not exactly the most efficient means for anyone not technically minded. The Apple version is available in the app store. Even so, once logged on there was a limited choice of movies, about 8 per genre, and music. Very paired down compared to the Singapore Airline parent IFE. Meal was also a simplified choice of either of two dishes. However drinks were plentiful and free flowing through the whole flight.

On the Cairns to Singapore leg I was seated next to an obese person who intruded as much as 15cm into my seat. I had booked and paid for an exit row because of my height. I am 192cm, 90kg fit and healthy 71yo. I continually asked him to keep to his own seat but it was impossible for him. If he leaned forward his stomach forced his legs into my seat squab. He threatened to punch me. I reported the threat to the attendants and they spoke to him. I was offered a middle standard seat which I had to refuse because of my height. He could have easily been moved to the business section which was occupied by only one staff member passenger. I wrote to them asking for a FOC on only the CNS-SIN sector next time I fly to Eastern Indonesia but they offered a free exit seat CNS-SIN-CNS. Lots of corporate double talk and insincere apologies. If you buy a car and it has no motor you can ask for and get a replacement. I purchased a seat and only got 66% of it and I want a replacement. ",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,3,1,3,4,,5,3,yes
silkair,Dexter Lee,2017-05-02,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Luang Prabang return in April, with a stopover in Vientiane on the outgoing leg to Laos. Second time on SilkAir this year and I was very pleased with the service to Luang Prabang. Check-in went without a hitch and boarding for the flight was quick as it was a low load on the Singapore to Vientiene sector. I was served a total of six times on my flight to Luang Prabang by a very cheerful bunch of cabin attendants - snacks, drinks, wine, meals desserts etc! The main meal of chicken pasta was alright but I wish they didn't skimp on the salad. Flight wasn't full so I had lots of room to stretch. Arrival in Luang Prabang was on time even with the slight delay in Vientiane. On the return flight it was a direct trip to Singapore without a stopover - this time round I think they were running short of wine as they only served this in a cup and didn't give out bottles. The main meal was seafood pasta, which was way better than the lunch I got. Once again, they skimped on the salad. Inflight entertainment was quirky and the app crashed a lot. Good thing that I got newspapers on both legs of the journey. All in all the cabin crew service was top notch and I really felt that they provided a great service. This airline does have room for improvement, but I can say that SilkAir is still quite a worthy and solid performer.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,9,5,5,4,4,5,5,yes

silkair,Dexter Lee,2017-04-04,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore - Penang - Singapore in late March and early April. SilkAir's cabin service exceeded my expectations. Boarding on both legs were orderly and efficient. On both the outbound and inbound flight we had some really friendly and cheerful cabin crew who'd go out of the way to help their passengers. Refreshments on the two flights were served as soon as the flights were airborne, and the sandwiches served were tasty. Seats on both flights were comfortable enough for the short one hour journey each way with sufficient pitch and width. Outgoing flight to Penang had a late departure but on time arrival, but the return flight left the gate ten minutes early and arrived in Singapore well ahead of schedule. If there's one area where I was dissatisfied it would be the inflight entertainment system which involves streaming content to mobile devices or computers. Android users (like myself) have to download the SilkAir IFE app in order to log on to the entertainment system, and by the time I got it running properly on the outbound flight the aircraft was ready to land. On the return flight the inflight entertainment app worked well for a while, until it started to crash while playing certain songs. All in all, I'm happy with the SilkAir experience, but I can't give them full marks for the IFE - I really hope they are able to make their inflight entertainment system more user-friendly in future.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,9,5,5,4,3,5,5,yes

silkair,E Dayanto,2017-01-03,"✅ Verified Review |  Surabaya to Singapore return. It was our first time flying SilkAir's newest Boeing 737-800. This new aircraft has Sky Interior design which is very beautiful and relaxing. Our flight to Surabaya took-off on time and landed ahead of schedule by 10 minutes. The ground staff at Changi International Airport was very helpful when she gave us assistance to use the Self Check-in kiosk for the first time. It was quite simple to use. After a few clicks you can print out your boarding pass as well as your luggage tag then you can proceed to the check-in counter to drop your luggage. However, we had a minor problem when we dropped our bags at the check-in counter, an agent told us only two out of three bags were registered. Then that agent helped us to recheck-in our three bags altogether. The in-flight services were very good and the meals had nice taste. Once we landed at Juanda International Airport, there was another minor problem with the baggage delivery. We were told our baggage would be delivered from carousel number 4 and waited for about 10 minutes before it then moved to carousel number 3 . Again, it took ages to get our bags delivered; there were approximately 10-15 minutes intervals to collect all the three luggage. It was not Silk Air's fault but the delivery system at Juanda which needs to be sorted out.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,9,4,4,4,4,5,5,yes
silkair,B Sharma,2016-12-26,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Coimbatore return. Check-in was efficient but the staff member was rather haughty in her dealings with us until she discovered our class of travel. A family travelling in Economy Class was rudely turned away from the Business Class line, leaving a bad impression. The SilverKris lounge in Terminal 3 was comfortable but unimpressive, though the staff were excellent. SIN-CJB flight was in SilkAir's newest Boeing 737-800 (9V-MGQ) and the flight back was in their oldest one (9V-MGA). The former was in a very good condition but the latter, despite being less than three years old, had many scuffs throughout the cabin. The service was not quite as polished as on Singapore Airlines, though this was because of the constraints of the hard product. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive, always ready to attend to the passengers while remaining unobtrusive. Meal service with a welcome drink and light snack before a three-course meal later in the flight. The meals were not as extravagant as those served by other airlines in Business Class, but were sufficient. I appreciated the small touches such as the festive cookies served with the snack and chocolates served after the main meal. The superb cabin crew were let down by the poor product. The seat, though spacious, had manual controls which seized up frequently. My seat (2A) did not recline at all. A tablet (an iPad on the outbound flight to CJB and a Lenovo on the return leg) was provided together with a pair of disposable earphones to access SilkAir's wireless IFE but the selection was paltry and the audio was drowned out by the ambient noise. Furthermore, the lack of a tablet holder made using the IFE system for prolonged periods difficult. With a price of almost SGD 2500 return per traveller, and given that several other airlines in the region (such as Dragonair, Qatar Airways and Malindo Air) have superior product and service onboard similar aircraft, SilkAir comes up short.",Family Leisure,Business Class,6,4,5,4,2,3,1,no
silkair,L Pang,2016-12-19,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Kunming. Very disappointing for a full service airline and not worth being called the regional wing of Singapore Airlines. Seats were very similar in space and comfort to budget carriers such as Jetstar. I am 190cm tall and my knees were really digging into the seat in front of me. Not what you would expect of a full service airline. Although the Boeing 737-800 was less than a year old, the seats were already showing signs of wear - greying and tattered. For a 4hr flight to Kunming this was almost unbearable. Food was also not up to standard. I would expect a full meal service from SilkAir on such a long flight. However the meal was very small and barely enough for this sector. There are only 2 toilets available for the 150-odd passengers in economy. Together with the slow meal service, this caused the rear of the aircraft to be constantly congested. I feel sorry for those seated in the vicinity of the toilet as they had to deal with people squeezing in the narrow aisle and eating into their already limited personal space. Inflight entertainment is also poor. Not only is there no in seat IFE, the wifi IFE system is also very limited in content. The content that it did have was not recent nor popular. Worst of all, the prices paid for the flight are full Singapore Airlines fares and that sours the whole experience.

On a separate ticket, we're flying to Singapore this morning on tickets purchased through Singapore Airlines online. As a Platinum Premier member on Star Alliance, my family and I are allowed 50kg each. Singapore Airlines confirmed this was accurate in an email. So, we packed accordingly. However, as the flight was operated by SilkAir and they allow only 30kg each. The ticketing agents at Chiang Mai airport are only contractors and are completely unempowered to make any decisions. The Silk Air supervisor, made a ridiculous attempt to call someone to get permission and could only tell me no and that he was sorry, which I appreciated only slightly, but sorry didn't solve our problem. We had 10kg too much and he was not budging. Finally, we unloaded as much as we could into carry-on bags and we we're still 4kg over. He would not budge. Any amount of reasoning would not work. Finally, he whimpered off and hid from me. The contract agent, who was embarrassed, finally just told him it was at weight and put our bags through.

Silkair at Danang needs to lift its game in its lounges, the service inflight was really good.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,5,4,5,3,3,1,3,yes
silkair,Lina Abdat,2016-01-09,"Singapore to Lombok with SilkAir and problems with booking - slow response. Two to go promotion but at the last minute the second passenger became ill and unfit to fly with doctors letter, and after much deliberation and arguments I was allowed to fly without having to pay the extra amount they wanted me to in the first place. I was sent a late email to check in for flight, without the office calling to inform as promised. Ground staff at check in made me wait for a wheelchair assistant till last minute even though this was booked way in advance. Food served onboard was okay and the cabin crew were good and professional.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2,2,3,2,,2,3,no
silkair,Leon Ha,2016-01-06,"Singapore to Kuching, and I love the new uniform the SilkAir crew is wearing. I requested to change my seat and the ground staff at Changi Airport T2 helped me without much fuss. 4-star service from cabin crew, the inflight entertainment is pretty good. Works well on my iPhone 5c. Fair amount of entertainment considering SilkAir only operate short haul flights.  Food was fine. Overall I still recommend SilkAir to others.

silkair,S Siauw,2016-01-04,"SilkAir from Bandung to Singapore Changi SIN. Flight got overbooked. Got an upgrade to business class. Cabin crew polite just a bit rushed in the galley during meal service. All in all pleasant short flight, with great food and good choice of tea.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,8,4,4,4,3,3,5,yes
silkair,L Aritonang,2016-01-03,"Short SilkAir flight from Singapore to Medan one way. The ground service at Changi airport were very professional and boarding was smooth. The seat was standard for short haul flight and the plane seems very well maintained. The meal was average but I didn't make a big deal out of it since it was a short flight. Even though it was short flight, they still provided entertainment service via wireless connection. This is my first time flying with Silk Air and I will fly with them in the future. The price is premium though but you will get what you paid for.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,8,4,4,3,4,5,4,yes
silkair,Daniel Kunhiraman,2015-12-29,"I recently flew from Cairns to Bangalore via Singapore with SilkAir return. The aircraft was new and had a modern interior. The legroom though for a 6hr flight from Cairns to Singapore was inadequate and uncomfortable. Also, I found that when asking for minor things like some water, the staff seemed uninterested and like I was putting them out. Also, poor selection of choice from the SilkAir Studio to watch a movie through the inflight wifi on your device. Food was ok and adequate, but took a very long time to be served, much longer than most Airlines I have flown. Some positives though is the convenience to get to India, especially from a regional city like Cairns, with only one stop instead of two, unlike before. Also the price of the ticket was very reasonable considering it was peak season for travel to India. Overall, though I may look to fly another carrier in the future as my overall experience with SilkAir was not that great. Would much prefer to stick to Singapore Airlines.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,5,2,2,3,1,3,4,yes
silkair,X H Shen,2015-12-10,"The SilkAir flight from Singapore to Hanoi was enjoyable, however the distribution of meals was rather slow and unprofessional of the cabin crew. The seats give adequate legroom but lack PTVs and there were only small dropdown screens from above. The landing was really smooth though.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,6,3,3,4,2,3,3,yes
silkair,Kaylee Mead,2015-10-21,Singapore to Darwin with SilkAir was a very uncomfortable flight I am a short person but the legroom was very tight. A German guy sitting across from me was 6ft tall and permanently had his knees buried in the seat in front. Leg room not designed for taller westerners even though we were travelling to a western country.,Family Leisure,Economy Class,3,1,2,2,1,2,2,no
silkair,Clarence Beh,2015-09-30,"Cairns to Singapore via Darwin, using SilkAir. I arrived at 09.30 for 11.15 flight, but they couldn't for some obscure reason, find my booking. I could see my name on list, but couldn't get a boarding pass. As I was leaving Australia permanently, I had one extra suitcase, until they informed me it would cost $940 US - my whole ticket only cost $640 AUD. Got boarding pass 3 minutes before takeoff. I booked online, and in seat selection, the only seat that showed as available was an exit row, so I had paid $52AUD extra for seat. I was told at airport that I couldn't have the seat as I use a walking cane, and no refund was available. Onboard there was no entertainment -  6 hours to Singapore, no music or tv. One hour from Darwin, I asked FA for a can of beer and she advised, sorry no beer. All I can say is that the cabin staff are friendly. ",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2,1,3,1,,1,1,no
silkair,Francis Wong,2015-09-10,"I booked SilkAir as a business class deal from Hong Kong via Singapore. The aircraft is a small type, understandable for a short regional flight. It has 8 business class seats, interesting thing was, I happened to be be only one on board that day! Service was very attentive, choice of 2 hot breakfast, I chose the Malay option an was delicious. The seat is reclining type but is spacious and made of leather. A lenovo pad was provided to me for entertainment, plus the overhead TV. A very pleasant 2:30 hours went past before landing safeky at Yogyakarta airport. All in all a great experience.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,8,4,5,4,3,4,4,yes
silkair,Sam Mathew,2015-08-13,The outbound flight from COK was on time and the crew were tolerant to us even though we were a bit late to get to the gate. The crew were friendly and the food was okay (had ordered an avml meal). The boeing sky interior was fantastic. The leg space was a bit small. Im around 6 foot and I was cramped. The crew were friendly and pleasant. The toilet was clean too. However I can't believe that they have no personal IFE screens and no headphones were provided either. I spent the 4 hour journey reading and sleeping. The inbound flight was pretty much the same as the the outbound but the seats were quite worn out. The worst thing was the food. ,Family Leisure,Economy Class,5,2,4,2,1,4,3,no
silkair,Sam Mathew,2015-08-12,SilkAir isn't the best airline I've travelled with. COK-SIN was on time and the crew was tolerant even though we were a bit late getting to the gate. The crew were friendly and the food was okay (ordered an avml meal). The Boeing Sky Interior was fantastic. The leg space was small. I'm around 6ft and I was cramped up a bit. The crew were friendly and pleasant. The toilet was clean too. SilkAir had no personal IFE screens. They don't provide headphones either. I spent the 4 hour journey reading and sleeping. The inbound flight was pretty much the same as the the outbound. The worst thing was the food. It was horrible.

silkair,Bradley Baker,2015-07-06,"Our flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpar was great. The flight is only 45mins but had a drink service, and WiFi - I didn't expect them to have this option. You can also listen to music, read about the airline and watch a small variety of movies. This seats were comfortable. The only disappointment was there was no snack with the drinks.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,9,5,5,3,4,5,5,yes
silkair,J Rui,2015-06-18,"Check-in counters opened 2 hours before the flight and a queue formed as early as an hour before the counters opened. Being a PPS club member, was able to queue at business class queue even though I flew economy. The ground crew had a list of the names allowed to queue in the business class check in queue and those who were not flying business class or PPS club members were asked to queue in the economy class queue which made the line short. Ground crew and flight crew very friendly. Route was via Cebu and was invited to use the lounge in both Davao and Cebu which had decent food options. Flight crew very professional and friendly even though it was an almost full load in economy. One complaint is that they run out of food options early and those at the rear only had one choice of food left. Crew very apologetic but this is not the first time this happened on SilkAir (happened in my inbound leg to Davao too). Both food options were good though. Didn't try the entertainment system and most passengers chose to sleep through the flight. It was an enjoyable flight and am so glad that they have this very convenient connection between Singapore and Davao.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,9,4,5,4,,5,4,yes
silkair,Sebastian T Leahy,2015-05-31,I went on MI599 bound for Kalibo. The service was excellent food and beverages were fairly good the seat pitch was excellent. The cabin crew service was excellent. I would suggest to add LED or AVOD personal TV screens as it was a 3.5 hour flight with not a lot of entertainment. Other than that I rate my experience 100%!,,Economy Class,9,5,4,4,2,,4,yes
silkair,G Brambilla,2015-05-20,SIN-KUL economy (MI342) 13 May 2015. I took this flight as my previous flight into Singapore was delayed meaning that I missed my connection. The service is generally inferior to Singapore Airlines. The airplane is neat and tidy with reasonable comfortable seats (it was ok for a 45 minute flight). Food consisted in a small drink (orange juice) without even a glass; poorer than usual 3-4 stars European airlines. the flight was on time and cabin crew was generally pleasant. not particularly attentive though. A service comparable to a 3 star European carrier.,,Economy Class,6,,,,,,3,yes
silkair,P Lewis,2015-04-14,Singapore to Siem Reap in Economy. Decent A320 which was clean and comfortable. We did not eat the food as we ate at the airport before the flight but for a relatively short flight the food looked substantial-comings from Europe a shorthaul flight with 'proper' food is a rarity these days! Got to chose our seats beforehand online when booking so that was good-no extra charge for that or baggage. Recommend for a short haul trip-but in reality they are not that cheap-we could have gone Business Class on Vietnam Airlines for the same price but that would have meant a connection in Saigon which would be a pain - Silkair are I think the only direct service between Singapore and Siem Reap so I guess they price accordingly (don't blame them for that).,,Economy Class,9,,,,,,4,yes
