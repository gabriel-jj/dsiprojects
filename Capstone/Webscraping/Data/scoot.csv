scoot,Paul Morel,2020-05-01,"Not Verified |  Returning as cheaply as possible Perth to Bangkok. Booked 2 weeks before the flight on 17th, COVID-19 was already disrupting transport, Singapore was days from closing Changi, and Thailand obviously close to closing BKK and I was using visa exempt so concerned. No problem at check in, flight left on time, guess 15% full. I regard Scoot as really too good for a cheapo, seat is same as full service airline, of course no drink, food, entertainment, and only 10kg but I pay to be transported. In Changi told that flight SIN to BKK was consolidated 4 x 320 into 1, so an 8 hour delay, a potential refund was mentioned but no use to myself to be stuck in Singapore. Good flight 320 to BKK about half full and on time and allowed into Thailand, phew! BKK empty, through immigration and in taxi before ETA. Actually better than usual good Scoot flights as flight crew not so insistent of pushing expensive food, coffee, drinks, guess they were all on notice, I wish them well and base my 10/10 of their consolidating my flight as driven by economic necessity. Hope they survive and in a similar way.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,10,4,2,,,5,5,yes
scoot,Constance Crampton,2020-04-26,"Not Verified |  We have used Scoot before and highly recommended them previously. Now with our cruise cancelled we have firstly asked for voucher refund to use later this year. As with the uncertainty of travelling this year we emailed for our cash refund instead. No response, we only got ""we will get back to you within 10 working days"" - nothing!. A phone call to them 1 month later and after 40 minutes of back and forth on hold with customer service we were told no you cannot change it. We asked for reasoning and to have a response in writing as verbal communication was difficult, and nothing .. so disappointing that they treat previous clients this way!",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2,,,,,,1,no
scoot,Mick Tobor,2020-04-15,"✅ Trip Verified |  On our way to Bangkok airport we received a voucher for the cancelled flight home!  A new internet booking for 9.000 baht isn’t possible, instead we have to buy an overpriced ticket for 21.000 baht. After buying the ticket they didn’t want to let us fly! We showed an email from the Greek ministery of foreign affairs giving green light for my wife - and they checked us through to Athens. In Singapore Scoot denied boarding to my Korean wife (not me). we tried to show the mfa email, they didn’t want to see it. The boarding staff sent us to Transfer D: „there’s a Scoot office“ taking care of everything and they will help us. But in transfer D there’s just a night staff, who can’t do anything for us and many other Scoot nightmare guests.  No service, no food, no water, no help at all. Our luggage is not available - it’s behind immigration . If we go out, we’ll be quarantined for 14 days. The Scoot manager is kidding us: We need a medical certificate, we would get it in a clinic nearby. But this clinic doesn’t test anyone - and the manager should know it.  No flight money back! The manager was generous enough to give us the flight to Bangkok instead of Athens. Since march 20 Scoot didn’t refund anything, doesn’t answer emails.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,1,,,,,1,1,no

It consists 2 flights depart on 19 Mar 2020, the 2nd connecting flight is from Singapore to Hong Kong. I checked again iternary on 18 Mar night, this 2 flights were confirmed. But early i arrive airport to check-in, staff told me the 2nd flight to HK has been cancelled and seem they can cancel flight any time with no advance notification and no valid reason. The Scoot manager in Melbourne airport was unhelpful only saying flight cancelled and insist cannot offer alternative/solution,  and said no next Scoot flight to HK in coming days, Scoot can take me to Singapore only or can get refund.

scoot,Francis Wong,2020-03-13,"✅ Trip Verified |  Due to severe reduction of flights from Singapore to Hong Kong because of CoVid-19, I could not choose to fly with my favourite: Singapore Airlines, all their afternoon flights have been cut. I was left with the only reasonably priced option: Scoot. For today (Mar 12th), their 787 was deployed, and I was rather curious and looked forward to trying it. I had problems with check in at their computer kiosk, was directed to the assistance counter to complete my check in. The lady was not friendly nor very helpful. Never mind, hopefully the flight experience will make up for it. For today, no meals or duty free will be available to purchase. Instead, each passenger was given a bottle of water and a packaged croissant. I was sat the the so called quiet zone, load factor was very low, they still insisted to sit a lady in our seat of 3, where she could have any other seats (all 3 to herself!), not her fault but the airlines. The thing to do would be to move to another empty to give her more room (and myself), I was not allowed to. I was told due to the virus situation, passengers must not move to any seats for tracing purpose later if necessary. As a result, all 3 of us squeezed onto 6 D,E and F, endured a very uncomfortable flight, inside a 30% full cabin, thanks to the cunning arrangement of the check in agent. I had to take Scoot because I had no other choice, and they did not show me that flying with them had any benefits, besides the low price. 787 usually is very nice plane, but when it becomes a Scoot plane, it looked cheap and tattered everywhere, with very tight seat pitch, cabin crew were so so, doing the bare minimum.

scoot,D  Charkova,2020-03-06,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bali to Tokyo via Singapore. I had the worst experience during check in at Bali international airport. I was flying back home using 2 different airlines, no baggage, terminals I fly in is the same I fly out, all airports I fly in have transit zone.  The employee of scoot refused to give me my boarding pass cause I did not have visa to Japan, I did not need visa in this case I could easily transfer to my next flight without leaving the terminal. After asking him for a while to verify everything he was just sitting there and replying all the same ""I cannot"" . I asked to give me my boarding pass only to Singapore and he told me I cant get it as well cause I need flight back and if I buy a new ticket in front of him he can give it to me otherwise I wont get anything and simply losing all my flights. I asked for a manager and he refused to call the manager or somebody, I asked to provide me a complaint form and he refused to do so, he refused to give even a phone call to somebody who knows more then him.  All I wanted is to go home and not being stuck in Indonesia. Somehow I was able to get my boarding pass to Singapore from other agent who was very nice an understanding, she checked everything and verified that I actually can get my boarding pass. Thanks to other employee I was able to fly home without problems. As a company who are involved in international flights every employee should be familiar with every aspect of international travels. It is very serious for many people to be where they need to be on time.

scoot,H Andrews,2020-02-27,"✅ Trip Verified | My first time flying with Scoot having read so many negative reviews for this airline. I found a great deal one way to Bangkok and just couldn't resist, so I took a chance. Around 200 AUD one way. Overall my experience was not too bad. If you expect something fancy from this budget airline, you have to ask something, what is important? Is comfort important or simply getting from point A to B? I chose the latter. Most of the time I took a nap while listening to music, so I wasn't in too much discomfort. Leg room was decent. My advice bring your own pillow if you have trouble sleeping on the plane. Overall Scoot did the job. This isn't Singapore Airlines in any manner. If being economical is important for you, give Scoot a try.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,7,3,3,,,5,5,yes

scoot,Brett Gore,2020-02-15,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Singapore. We flew Scoot Airlines Scoot Plus cabin. This used to be called Scoot Biz but they changed it because of too many complaints that it was nowhere near business class. It is really a Premium Economy product at a budget price. You also get designated check in, priority boarding and disembarkation. There are negative reviews of the Scoot Biz or Scoot Plus product. You get what you pay for. The ticket price if you are doing a return trip is not much more than economy on full service airlines and much less than any premium economy tickets. The seats are fabulous, 20 inches wide with 38 inches leg room and 6 inches recline just like most premium economy airlines. However, you need to bring your own entertainment or device and can purchase extra wi-fi. You get one meal and drink on this 7 hour flight. Sadly, the food is not great. This is the downside. It is what we would call TV dinner standard and portion size. You can bring your own snacks, no problem but have to purchase their drinks.

Awful food, so overpriced, but portion so small and Nasi Lemak was filled with sweet sauces rather than actual ingredients. Seat had a missing recliner button, and when I sent in feedback all I was told was they ""checked and there was nothing wrong with the seat"". Insinuating that I was making things up, instead of giving me the benefit of the doubt. Very interesting how this could be when the button as missing from the seat! I even sent in a photo of the evidence showing the button missing. They ignored my e-mails thereafter even though I repeatedly e-mailed to ask for a follow-up.

scoot,J Martin,2020-02-05,"✅ Trip Verified | Flight TR-019 was scheduled to depart from Melbourne to Singapore at 1.20 pm AEST on the 3rd of February 2020. Due to technical issues they made us stay inside the aircraft while they were working on the issue. For the first, one and a half hours to about 2 hours, the air conditioner was not working, when asked the attendant informed they were experiencing some technical issues. Upon seeing passengers uncomfortable and some literally sweating, they called in technician and set it up. The entire process took about 5 hours and we waited patiently only to be told Melbourne authorities had given a red flag to depart and that we are to disembark only to start the process of standing at the counter all over again. We had to go through immigration and back to check in counter. Now the representatives knew there was another flight flying at 10.30 pm AEST and so their priority was to check-in passengers boarding that flight, while leaving 225 passengers (as told) from cancelled flight stranded at the airport waiting in long queues unattended. I had to wait for 5 hours and 45 minutes for my turn (not even exaggerating). Though I was given two options (if I wanted to take the flight), both the options were delayed by more than 24 hours. What is shocking is that there was a similar incident by the same flight TR-019 just a week before on the 27th of Jan 2020 to be exact. They had to cancel the flight due to technical issues.

The Scoot call centre was obviously trained to say sorry and nothing else and offered no more information.

scoot,Y Han,2020-01-29,"✅ Trip Verified |  I took Scoot on a return flight from Melbourne to Singapore. There's no in-flight entertainment, but this is acceptable given that it's a budget flight. What is unacceptable is the lack of cabin service. On the first flight, I was told by a crew member that no outside food was allowed. This is unreasonable as I have strict dietary requirements and could consume none of the main meals offered on board. None of the other airlines that I have flown with have ever picked an issue with passengers bringing their own food on board. I tried to buy a packet of nuts with my debit card but the crew first rejected my debit card, and asked for cash or credit card (which I had none), without giving any reasons. Only after I asked for the reasons that I found out that there is a limit of $20 spending on debit cards and they are phasing out debit card payments. I'm certain this wasn't made known to passengers prior to boarding. This is terrible for passengers on long haul flights who aren't aware of this limit, on top of the fact that Scoot does not allow outside food or serve water for free. The return flight was dismal. I had paid for a seat upgrade but found out that my seat could not recline as the button had dropped out. This was obviously a problem that the airline had previously known of, as there was duct tape around the sharp edges around where the button would have been. I highlighted this to the a cabin crew and her response was ""oh ya, doesn't work. Sorry about that"" and tried to walk off! I had to ask if there was a replacement seat, and (of course) there wasn't any in the same seat class. The cabin crew also talk over passengers to each other across the aisles and can come across as quite curt in their instructions / responses to passengers. I get that Scoot is trying to create a young and less formal vibe but there needs to be more courtesy in the way the cabin crew treat passengers. It is honestly quite embarrassing that Scoot is a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, which prides itself on its high standards of service. I love flying on Singapore Airlines and think that they could do with more staff training for Scoot.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,,1,1,no

She also forced me wake up my child just so I could find the infant belt she gave me, And warned me that I am liable for the belt.

scoot,Robert Lucas,2020-01-19,"✅ Trip Verified | Ho Chi Min City to Melbourne via Singapore. We were recommended Scoot by our travel agent (former Travel Agent). Scoot does not have an economy class it's more of a cattle class. There was nothing budget about the cost of the tickets and we were prepared for not having a meal on board but could not believe that not even water was provided. First, we were told that we had to pay for it in Singapore dollars, they then relented and said we could use a credit card ($10 min. purchase). The service on board was disgraceful. Before leaving Melbourne I spent a day arranging additional luggage at a cost of $220 and after numerous phone calls they still could not be bothered to send me confirmation - it was left to me to explain it at the airport. Automatic check-in did not work as it kept telling me that information on passport did tot match E-tickets - more drama as consequently we could not print out our luggage tags. All four flights on our trip ended up running late. It seems that punctuality is not one of their virtues (they don't have any).

Scoot is a budget airline though you wouldn't know it from the attentive ground crew and the cabin crew we had on our flights from Perth to Athens. The best way to enjoy such a long flight (11.5 hours) is what we did by paying that bit extra and having extra leg room seat or/ exit row. It's totally worth it as there is no reclining seat in front of you and the access to get out of the seat makes the journey so much more comfortable. The only negative was the very worn carpet, unusual as it was a fairly new Boeing 787. The plane left on time in both Perth/Singapore and Athens.

scoot,N Meares,2019-12-17,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Sydney. For the most part, this airline does what they say on the box. It's a budget airline so you know you'll get the bare minimum unless you pay more which is fine. I was really disappointed with the meal service, I prebooked a ""meal, drink and snack"". They gave me no choice of drink and would only give me a 350ml bottle of water which I think is really misleading.  The meal was served almost immediately after departure for an 8 hour flight and I was told I couldn't  have it later. The flight left at about 0715 and my meal was a lunch/dinner option yet they served it as breakfast anyway. Refusing to give me an option honestly made it seem like they were rushing them out ASAP to get it out of the way since they already had my money, choosing to not care about what the customer wants, and hoping the unnecessarily early meal would lead to me needing a second meal later in the flight. I fly scoot semi-regularly and will never pre-book a meal again as a result. If it's any cheaper to pre-book it's only by about $1-2, so definitely not worth being misled about the drink and then force-fed the second you get on the plane. The stinginess with drinks doesn't even go away in their business class cabin which I've flown a couple of times in the past. They say you get a complimentary alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink, but upon asking for something like a whiskey and coke, you get told that whiskey is one free complimentary drink, so if you want coke it's a second drink you have to pay for! The only other issue I encountered was with the automatic check-in, where it refused to take my bag several times despite it being well within all the relevant limits. However, even with that delay, it was much quicker than with many other airlines so I can't really complain. I can't really fault the airline otherwise, they do pretty good deals and the seats aren't too bad. There's no inflight entertainment but in this day and age, I'd rather download something on my phone. Just ensure you have plenty of power as you'll be charged if you want to use the USB charger in your seat. I wouldn't recommend Scoot for a long journey like Australia to Europe, but for flights up to around 8 hours they're fine, just don't expect much other than a seat and a safe journey.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,5,3,2,1,,4,4,yes
scoot,A Sharali,2019-12-05,"✅ Trip Verified |  Coimbatore to Singapore. Friendly Check-in staffs (the only positive) in Singapore and in Coimbatore.  Most unfriendly crew i have met. Our group had traveled with 2 children one 1 year and 10 months and the other 2 years and 25 days old. Since my daughter was over 2 years she was given a separate seat and charged fully (acceptable as she has exceeded the age of the infant) Then during the take off they wanted her to sit separately in her seat and wear a seat belt. The kid had slept sitting on her moms lap as the flight's take off time was only by 12 20 am. The air hostess took her forcefully and put her on the other seat and it was a rough time after that. Then the hostess said sorry and accepted to let her sit with the mother. The same thing happened on our way back from Singapore. The steward tried to put my daughter in the separate seat and she wouldn't sit. there was an announcement from the pilot that the flight will be taken back to the gate if the child doesn't sit in the seat. Luckily she slept for a while and we could lean her onto her seat and managed to put the seat belt over her. During landing the crew (4 of them) came stood around us and made sure they woke my daughter up, made her cry and they tried to forcefully make her sit on her seat. I lost it and asked all of them to move away and i was going to complain against all of them when we landed and did so. Other airlines even though they give a separate seat considering the age (2 years) they accept the baby to sit with the parent and give a extended seat belt. But no empathy here. They introduced Scoot as a budget airline. But it is no way cheaper compared to SilkAir. Travel with Silkair was so pleasant.  But Fly scoot such a joke. S$3 for water, S$15 for blanket etc etc. Even the cost is not an issue but the way they treated us was terrible. Sorry this will be my last ever travel with Fly scoot.

Now I have no choice but to waste 6 hours with nothing more than a spurious apology from the ground staff who appeared just as blur as the frustrated passengers. My simple question to the airline why were there no updates after 0530 ..  is it not common courtesy and indeed normal procedure to keep passengers informed so that even if they cannot do anything about the delay at least they don't have to have salt rubbed in by having to waste time waiting in a crowded and noisy substandard airport?

Didn't even offer an additional suitcase or an upgrade. Just to make it clear, Scoot will provide you with 4 different flights for one day, but will cancel it if is not full and just reschedule your ticket, until there is only one flight a day. Just an advice if you are traveling with Scoot, have your entire day available for them because they will treat their customers as if the only thing they had to do was take their flight.

This was totally unsuitable for me so I tried to find a different flight that flew on the same days but there were no longer any Scoot flights. Alternative options would be on different airlines. As I had made my booking through a travel agent, nothing was offered to me, even though I paid the same amount than I would direct. Not even to accommodate me on a partner airline (something I believe would have been offered IF i'd booked direct) and I'm left to bear the cost of something that was entirely on the blame of the airlines. Call Support center staff were not helpful at all and kept directing us to email in (from previous experiences, this never gets responded to on time and help is minimal). I think their customer service is really horrendous and they provide nothing of value when customers are in urgent need.

It was impossible to close the blinds, so there was light constantly. There was no opportunity to charge your phone for free (only for 5$) and no TVs. If you order a meal for 13€, you only get one dish (very small), a bottle of water or a coke and one dessert, e.g. a friend got a 15g pack of crisps, we got a “Ritter Sport” chocolate. I can accept all of these things for a cheaper price, but I expect to get at least some water. On our second flight, they promised we could fill up our water bottles in between the security check and before going into the plane, but then they said it’s too late and we’ve been in there with nothing.

There we were told something none of us could have anticipated: Scoot stopped flying to Kalibo or Caticlan long ago. What are we supposed to do then? Why did we received multiple emails leading to the actual day calling us to pack our bags and complete online check in. FYI I was unable to checkin online but didn’t thought of it as weird. Those were not the first questions “Scoot” ground staff or even the call center thought of. Their first question to address: “It’s not our fault you didn’t receive the emails we sent! Let us dig for proof.” So it became a contest of proof vs proof. Meaningless and waste of our time. In that time we could have booked a flight to Manila and reach Kalibo by the evening. No, Scoot and their ground staff would like to play a game of “let’s ignore them till they go away”. We were blatantly shunned and no one would attend to us for about one hour while the most responsible person there was busy solving other problems. Even worse, all of the ground staff totally disassociated themselves from Scoot, even as they wear Scoot badges and T-shirts. They told me they cannot make decisions or do anything because they don’t work for Scoot - how blatantly they declared that. I wonder if Scoot cares about Customer Service.

Service is great, in many ways no different to some regular airlines. The meals however, is an area which they don't really shine. It's ok, just that it cannot compare with Jetstar Asia, which excels in this area. Other than that, everything is just the same, get you from A to B at a reasonable price (but do shop around first).

In saying this, all flights were on time, departure was easy and carry on allowances are 10kg instead of the usual 7kg. Seats were ok, except no head rest, which you have to pay extra for. You also had to pay extra for food, water and any other beverages. Inflight entertainment was also at an additional cost as well as a blanket and pillow. You pay for a seat and that's literally all you get. Seats on the Dreamliner had better than average leg space however flights on the smaller A320 plane (DPS- SIN) were very tight.

scoot,J Han,2019-05-31,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Athens. I initially planned for a connecting flight 2 with a layover duration of 2 hours. Scoot however, revised their schedule a couple of weeks before my flight, reducing my layover time by 20 minutes. On the flight day, we saw that the flight was re-timed. We went to the check in counter to entire, but the counter staff were not even aware that the flight was re-timed. They checked and advised us that the flight departure time will be delayed by 2 hours, but the arrival time will remain the same, which is ridiculous. We went through the customs and went straight to the gate. The gate did not even display the updated flight time. There was no communication to the passengers, all waiting in vain and frustrated. No customer service representative came to address the issue. We called up the call center, which was outsourced, and they too, have no idea that the flight was re-timed. We went to confirm with the lounge staff, who advised us there was in fact a delay of 2 hours, arrival time will be delayed by another 2 hours too. We understand that the delay was due to the earlier flight being delayed, because they were waiting for 8 passengers who were performing their transit. In other words, Scoot opted to delay a whole plane full of passengers, just to accommodate to the 8 people. Very poor decision making and management on Scoot's behalf. While we were on the plane but yet to depart, the plane was being delayed for another hour. We understand that this was due to accommodating to the request of a single passenger who decided to disembark and then changed his mind to reembark again. This decision, again, costed the whole plane full of passengers another hour, just for the sake of a single passenger. We were seeking updates from the stewardess during the delay, but she does not have any clue as to what is happening, and she had this irritating habit of touching her hair once every 10 seconds or so. I missed my connecting flight eventually, and had to book another connecting flight. I wrote in to Scoot for the compensation. Their customer support team is outsourced, and have no clue that the flight was delayed. They kept insisting that the flight delay was less than 3 hours, until I requested them to show me the actual departure time and actual arrival time, versus the scheduled departure and arrival time. They kept replying with copy-and-pasted templates which added to my frustration. They have this ""promise to you"" page on their website which says that they will compensate with a travel voucher for any delay more than 3 hours. It has been more than a month since I raised this claim and till now, it has not been resolved. The issue being transferred from one customer service officer to another. Not too sure if they even intend to deliver this promise that they state on their website. Comprehensive travel insurance does not cover delay of less than 6 hours, but their customer service officer kept asking me to check with the insurance company for compensation. Scoot is an irresponsible airline, with poor customer service. With so many of Scoot's recent delays in the news, now I understand, this is of no surprise. Do avoid at all costs.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,,,1,1,no
scoot,T Marston,2019-05-25,✅ Trip Verified |  Manila to Phuket via Singapore. Hit with hundreds of dollars of overage fees on two carry-on bags we had to check because my friend and I booked our ticket in one reservation instead of separately. So 2 of us only get the checked bag allowance of one person (and the ticket costs the same as if we would have booked separately). This is not clearly explained when you book or confirm.

scoot,C Birlantes,2019-05-25,"✅ Trip Verified |  Manila to Singapore. I had pretty low expectations for this flight/airline after seeing many negative reviews after I already booked but it was a good no frills flight. The cabin staff that I was with were all professional, kind and efficient. Can't say enough good things about them. Honestly, I was kind of annoyed with the ground crew though. For the to SG flight, the ground crew were bordering talking down to the people trying the board (I get any group can be hard to deal with when not following instructions but you need to have some sort of control and courtesy). They called for first row, seniors, board me first. I was in the first row so I went yet the lady kept raising her voice and telling me later. I pointed out the seat number and told her to look at everyone tickets first. For the back to MNL flight, the ground crew just seemed inconsistent and rushed, eventually giving up on the section style bordering and just took everyone. It is what it is. As one can expect from a budget airline, there is no IFE and the food is not included. I found the menu very very pricey though even knowing their strategy. No problem with the seats since I got the stretch seats, I think it's worth it for big taller people(around $20-25) even for a short 3 hour flight.

scoot,T Marten,2019-05-21,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gold Coast to Bangkok via Singapore. To Scoot or not to Scoot In just one single trip I have come to the following conclusion about Scoot. There is inconsistency in the way they treat seat luggage allowance wise at different airports which cost us a lot. The web portal crashed multiple times when I tried to book luggage ... in the crash dump it said that they had ""been informed"" ... right. Maybe if the portal had worked I could have paid $105 return for luggage for my son as well instead of the total of $540. The air hostesses seems to look down on people, at least my wife who is kindness incarnated. The air hostesses seemed to have no information on extra seats and who is entitled to use them. The air hostesses apparently just assumed that we were getting off in Singapore .... the way they handled the stroller part in the story border lines theft of $400 in my books. It was only that I broke a massive sweat to ""pull it from the dumpster"" that I got my property back. The people in service phone has no clue about prices of luggage, again it seems this case falls out of their flow chart. The customer support does not respond, responds consistently only after the 10 days probably to wear you down and will apparently try and make you give up by death by paragraphs ... but I can read and this has become a matter of principle for me. The main issue was the the fact that we got trapped on the return to Gold Coast with luggage conditions that were suddenly different in Bangkok than in Gold Coast. This cost us A$300 extra  but even though thats a lot of money, there is a certain amount of unfairness to it which is why I am making my voice heard. I have written to Scoot regarding the excess luggage and waited the 10 days without a reply from them. Then I wrote again and have waited another 10 days without hearing anything. But then I heard from them with the following message: ""Our record shows that you have purchased an extra seat for your infant, however, infants are not considered as a full paying passenger. You may refer to our Conditions of Carriage 3.3 regarding infant passenger."" In fact under baggage allowance it says ""Infants not occupying a seat have no Checked Baggage allowance"" which must mean that our son, since he occupied a seat either had a checked baggage allowance or at least was allowed to have one. So, they seem they will do anything to deflect. I have written to them with this argument. And they replied back that they have considered it and that infants occupying a seat still cannot have Checked Baggage allowance.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,3,1,2,1,1,1,no

scoot,W Baker,2019-04-26,"✅ Trip Verified | Scoot HNL-KIX r/t. Our tickets were only about $300/person, including 1 checked bag and 1 meal in each direction. For this price we did not expect much but we were positively surprised. The plane was clean and spacious, it even had mood lighting. The seats were not overly comfortable but ok even for a 9 hr flight. Leg room was sufficient. The crew was very friendly and approachable so no complaints about the service. There was a 1 hr delay on the HNL-KIX segment but we were kept informed at the gate; the return flight was on time. The only complaint are the high food and drink prices - about US $3 for a small bottle of water and the pre-ordered meal would have been cheaper if bought on board (the on-board menu listed a price of Sin $18 and I paid US $18 during booking). I would fly them again although the next time I would eat before the flight and bring more snacks on board (snacks are supposedly allowed and we had no problems nibbling on our chocolate and nuts that we brought with us).

This time the experience was completely different. Arriving at Changi airport and immediately greeted by a well dressed lady who offered to help me check in. What! Help me check in to Scoot? I declined as I knew what I was doing, so I went to the Scoot area and there were 4 counters open and nobody in the queue. Immediately checked in with no hassle, very helpful lady. Looks like I bought my ""board me first"" for nothing. At the gate, everything was squeaky clean. Boarding was by row and not by ""board me first"". Still, no problem. Very friendly crew, and departed on time, landed early after 1 hour, bags all. Very well behaved passengers too. But no service was needed, no service was offered, no service need reviewing. Like boarding a bus and getting off. In summary for a short flight esp if you fly from Changi, Scoot does not appear to be a budget airline.

scoot,E Kan,2019-04-18,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tokyo to Singapore via Taipei. Keeping in mind that this is a budget airline, everything about it is budget, but it was below my very low expectations - I feel for the staff who are just trying to do their job as directed by the company. First the positives - everything was hassle free, they are super on-time, no delays, 100% efficient at doing the important bits of getting you from A to B. But it stops there. Because we bought an upgrade after buying a meal for economy, we were not allowed to change our meal option from what we had paid extra for. Tip: it is best to buy a meal but do not choose anything otherwise you are stuck with it. The seats are uncomfortable and they are tilted forwards such that you are sliding off the seat the entire 10 hours of the flight. The foot rest doesn't do anything, and it only reclines six inches, both combined, you are still sitting completely upright. The seat belt sign is always on for some reason (even when there is no turbulence) and you are not allowed to use the bathroom half the duration of the flight (exaggeration). The food is not bad, but portion size is small. And finally the staff are not happy and they show it. It must be a horrible company to work for!

scoot,Amari Page,2019-03-25,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Melbourne via Singapore. I have flown on many airlines and scoot by far has been the absolute worst experience I have ever had traveling in my entire life by all measures. Every experience with them has been frustrating and ridiculous. I have never encountered more unhelpful and incompetent people in my whole life than those who work at scoots call centers and airport transfer desks.  I tried to check my bag in online but the website links did not work, the app did not work, and it took 30 mins to get through to call center. The representative put me on hold after every question because it was clear he did not know how to answer basic questions. Finally, he informed me bag would have cost 400 Singapore dollars if I had checked it in at the airport counter! And this is insane considering how extremely difficult it was for me to check it in ahead of time with none of their websites or apps working properly.  I was wondering if they intentionally cause their website and app to not work properly so that customers who need to check a bag get trapped at the airport with a fee twice as much as the actual flight. I also tried to check in through Scoot’s app 3 hours before flight. To my panic, the app said that my flight had already departed which was entirely not true since it was 3 whole hours early! A kind of glitch like this is unacceptable on every level because of the panic that it would cause!!  The first of my two connecting flights were delayed 6 hours for “mechanical issues” and they did not even bother to notify me ahead of time. No email, no update on the app. The app said everything was on time! No one knew this under we got to the airport 6 hours early and had no options. Even when I had spoken to Scoot’s call agent to check my bag earlier, they did not mention this. I luckily found out through my travel agent, and since I was going to miss my connection, I had to make a new flight plan. Scoot was so unhelpful and incompetent that I was mind-blown. I wasted my entire last day of my trip on the phone with them which they ruined entirely! For absolutely no reason at all, they refused to simply put me on a different connecting flight that worked out with the delay time and had available seats. They said that I would have to just fly to my connecting airport and just take a risk and see what is available. When I finally got to my connecting airport, no one on my flight had any idea at all where to go or what to do, and the Scoot agents at the transfer counters were clueless. They sent me to the entirely wrong counters and kept giving me conflicting info about my checked bag.

scoot,S Deane,2019-03-14,"✅ Trip Verified |  Perth to Bangkok via Singapore. Another very good flight above and beyond the expected standard. Scoot receives a bad press. A recent reviewer on You Tube complains at great length that the airline failed to deliver any of the services it never promised to deliver in the first place, and that it was all but impossible to remove the film covering his meal. I suggest next time this reviewer takes time to check Scoot's terms and conditions, as clearly outlined on the website, and the instructions on the food package. Like the reviewer, I had a choice for my flight. My choice was to fly business class with Scoot for $100 less than a 'full fare; airline charged for a seat in economy. This is cash i would rather have in my back pocket than frittered on pointless trivialities and trinkets I can live without. Taking things as I found them, check-in was rapid - Scoot had a similar number of check in desks open for a 787 as Emirates were prepared to provide for an A380, with consequential length of queue. Boarding was smooth, departure more or less on-time departure with an early arrival in Singapore. Staff were friendly and keen to assist passengers wishing to access the IFE. Food was OK, especially the chocolate, with a wider choice of beer than many other airlines offer. One gripe, though this seems to a common issue with the B787: the passenger cabin was far too cold. However, knowing in advance what was (not) on offer in the way of a blanket, I came prepared with a body warmer. Departure from Singapore on the connection was likewise on time with similar levels of service, my checked bag safely delivered along with myself in Bangkok.
