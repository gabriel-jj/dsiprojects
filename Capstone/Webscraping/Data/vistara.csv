vistara,Jonathan Rivas,2020-04-08,"✅ Trip Verified |  Me and my partner were recently in India. We booked a ticket with Vistara from Goa to Delhi in order to be able to take our repatriation flight back to Europe. The Indian Government cancelled all domestic and internationals flights, including our domestic Vistara flight from Goa to Delhi. We asked the airline to give us a full refund for the flight that was cancelled. The airline refunded us half of the money back for the flight, saying that they didn't cancelled the flight, that it was government decision and that's why they charged a fee for the refund, and we only got back half of the money we payed. It's sad that a company like Vistara is profiting from a flight that never took place and that it is not willing to give a full refund to its customers specially in this time of crisis. I will not book anymore flights with Vistara again.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,1,,,,,,1,no

vistara,B Chardour,2020-02-12,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kolkata to Amritsar via Delhi, we had a short connection time of around an hour. The CCU to DEL flight was delayed thereby reducing transfer time severely. I raised it with the cabin crew and they showed no interest. We ran to the domestic transfer desk, up to that point there was nobody to help or ask. At the transfer desk vistara staff couldn't even be bothered to look at us: busy with their mobiles. I instructed them to call the ATQ flight team and let them know of our situation. They called them and asked ""what should I do with these people, do you want them on the flight?"". We were told we have to rush, I reminded them that their flight was delayed. The response was yes I know but now you run. The ATQ flight departed from Gate 52!! The opposite end of the airport. Upon check-in at CCU we enquired as to what will happen in case of a delay, we were assured that we will be collected and taken to the next flight, perhaps even a tarmac transfer: forget this, we weren't offered a buggie transfer to the gate in Delhi. Had I been travelling alone perhaps this wouldn't bother me so, however I was travelling with my elderly parents: in fact, my father celebrated his 80th birthday with a sprint through Delhi airport due to Vistara's incompetence. The return journey was equally bad in terms of a another hectic transfer and zero assistance from vistara. This time the chap at the transfer desk refused to call ahead and let them know we would be arriving. For all four flights the cabin crew were disengaged, service was slow. On the return, for both sectors non-veg meals were not available. It took an age for the bags to be delivered. Citing the above I asked Vistara to refund me the difference between Premium economy and economy as a premium service was simply not provided, they refused. We just received the standard template of apologies, needless to say won't be travelling with them again.",Family Leisure,Premium Economy,1,2,1,1,,1,1,no

There seemed to be a problem but everyone looked a bit embarrassed to tell us. Finally, we were told that the checkin time had been exceeded. We were directed toward a manager. He looked annoyed when we came to talk to him and got rid of us by finding us a powerless assistant to talk to. We finally learnt that we had been overbooked, which is surprising as we arrived pretty early. The assistant told us ""good news, you'll get a full refund"" whereas it was obvious that we were not going to pay for a service we did not get.

vistara,Dinesh Jhunjhnuwala,2019-08-21,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a gold tier member with Vistara and it is sad to see that their service standards going downhill. Yesterday I was flying from Hyderabad to Delhi with my wife and we were both booked on their Premium Economy class. I happen to have four upgrade vouchers which were given to me by a Credit card company which allows upgrade to the next class. Once I reached the airport, I told the check in lady that I had the vouchers and wanted to upgrade us to Business class and showed her the vouchers. She did not know what to do with them. She asked her senior  to come and have a look and he said that she should call up the ticketing counter and check if two seats were available in Business class and to tell them that two passengers wanted to use the vouchers for this upgrade. The ticketing people said it was fine so they asked that my vouchers be sent across to the ticketing people to carry out the formalities so that they could issue us the new Boarding passes in Business class. At that time, two gentlemen wearing the uniform of Vistara approached the Business class counter and got themselves checked in to Business class. This meant that the last two seats available got taken by the crew and they tell me that they can no longer offer me the two seats as the Business class is full. I got upset and told him that he had already allocated the two seats to us and also spoken to the ticketing people so why did he give up these seats. He then lied to me that they had confirmed booking. If that was indeed the case then why did the ticketing people agree to give us the two seats? I conveyed my displeasure  and told him that it makes no sense to be a Gold tier member and not be given priority to use these vouchers and they gave these seats to the crew who ought to have lower priority than the fare paying customers. He understood what I was saying and sent to the two gentlemen. Apparently one was nice enough to say that he would give up his Business class seat but the other person would not. They told us that we could consider taking up one of the seats in Business class. I declined the offer and told him that I would prefer to fly with my wife. As I was waiting for the check in, I also tweeted to the airline and explained to them what had transpired. They gave a standard reply that they would look into this and get back. Today a lady from Vistara reverted and apologised at the ""miscommunication"" between the ground staff and the controller. As I see it, there was no miscommunication and it was very clearly informed to me that we were getting the upgrade. To rub salt on my wounds, she gave a ""wonderful"" offer to extend a 10% discount on any one ticket for my future trip I might take on Vistara. She did not utter a word regarding the attitude of the crew who put self over the customer. I told her to keep her charity and I now intend to send them my four upgrade vouchers along with my membership card and stop flying this carrier.",Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,1,1,1,,,1,1,no

First they had a seat belt for infant that other cheap airline do not have; second  there are some special safety instruction for infant, in Vistara , the crew member asked me if I wish to listen instruction in Hindi or English and I choose English. This thing is very very important for me because if it is about safty of my Son I would like to listen in hindi only in which I am more comfortable.

When the flight started moving, cabin crew instructed me to feed the baby during takeoff but by that time my baby was frantic and started crying and I was stressed out. Had the instruction and been given bit in advance, I could have prepared so to avoid inconvenience to my baby and fellow passengers. No clear instruction was given about how the seat belt has to be tied for an infant.

vistara,Anna Whyte,2019-03-28,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bagdogra to Delhi. Without the fantastic and amazing service given by the staff and management at Vistara Airlines, I would not have been able to fly that day. I have a traumatic brain injury caused by a stroke and am extremely sensitive to noise and crowds. This is the worst airport I have ever encountered. I have flown there before so I was already feeling panicky. Luckily this time my 20 year old son accompanied me. Due to the roadworks throughout Sikkim, we had taken a private taxi early morning to reach IXB in time for our flight. We were very early so stopped at a good, quiet restaurant 15 minutes away from the airport. I took into the restaurant my BOSE sound cancelling headphones and silicone ear implants to make sure they were charged and ready for the impending chaos. We arrived at IXB 2.5 hours prior to departure. This airport has no priority security, no priority check in., no O disability facilities, NO lounge. To call it an international airport is a joke! As soon as the taxi pulled away I realised that I'ld left my headphones and silicone ear implants plus charger in the restaurant. I had a panic attack. My son sat me down in the shade where I vomited numerous times while he contacted the taxi driver and the restaurant. They had gone. My son has headphones so he gave me his but by now I was shaking and suffering Aphasia (inability to speak). He contacted Vistara staff who took me into the managers office, organised water, a calm and quiet space and informed us that they would board us last and 2 members of staff would accompany us through security. They helped my son with bag check in and boarding passes while other staff took care of me. They also helped us with items which we had left at the helicopter office. My son had an early morning flight from Delhi to Stockholm the next day. We both agreed that without the help of Vistara's amazing staff, in the worst conditions possible for my disability (IXB), he may not have made either flight as he would have been forced to take me to hospital. A big thank you to the Vistara Airline manager, who personally accompanied my son through security, and the professional staff at IXB and on board the aircraft. I first flew Vistara 1.5 years ago and have not flown another airline in India since then. This is India's best airline by far.

I had to go from Cochi to Chandigarh to see a vendor so I booked this flight at the last minute. When I got to the airport I learned about the weight limit for carry-ons. I begged and pleaded for them to make an exception because I had work materials and several other important items. I offered to pay for the bag but they said they really weren't able to allow weight overages in economy class. They could only do so for business class customers. The two agents tried hard to help me get an affordable business class. We weren't able to find any that were affordable, but they tried just about every thing they could to ensure that my bag was tended to. In the end they put special labeling on my bag  and did virtually everything they could to make sure my bag made it to my final destination. This meant a lot to me, given the circumstances. I've never seen service like this at an airline. They genuinely cared about my seemingly stupid luggage concern. The actual flight was great - organized boarding, great snacks, friendly airline attendants, and easy flight. This was so comforting and calming to me during a stressful time. Will definitely be flying with them again because I know that their service is impeccable and that if anything goes wrong they will do everything they possibly can to make it right.

Seat pitch and quality is very nice plus flexibility to choose preferred seats is added advantage. On board services are very good and aircraft interior is fresh.  Only thing I felt was that while flying on short route the food given in premium economy was at par with the normal economy and they used to give a welcome drink earlier in premium economy but I didn't find that in this flight. Plus the quality of refreshment was not good as I have experienced earlier. But overall on long flights, its very good and overall a worthy option to choose for flying in India.

Further ahead,the seat belt sign was not switched off for another 45 minutes after take off siting bad weather. Thus it must have been almost two hours from the time one reported to the boarding gate till the time the seat belt sign was switched off. I was traveling with my elderly parents in their eighties who wanted to go to the wash room about 20 minutes after the flight took off but were not allowed. However, the flight attendants wheeled in the food trolleys and started serving food during that time when the seat belt sign was still on. Other than this issue, the staff were quite efficient and courteous. The leg room was better than other domestic airlines. The food was good and adequate and the overall experience was pleasant. Another, irritant pertains to the prevalent norm in Chennai wherein the staff who assist with the wheel chair haggle over receiving a hefty tip . Overall traveling for the first time with Vistara was a good experience.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,7,5,3,5,2,3,5,yes
vistara,Monish Mathur,2018-06-26,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bengaluru to Ahmedabad. I have travelled a lot in last 2 years and have flown each of the Indian airlines, but Vistara is the best among all.

vistara,Arup Ghosh,2018-06-03,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kolkata to Delhi. I am a Platinum Member of their frequent flyer programme and have been so for two years now. Therefore my bias for this airline is obvious.  Vistara is the only Indian domestic airline which offers Premium Economy. Same 3+3 layout as Economy but with more generous legroom. Their Economy seats have a pitch of 31"" and recline of 3.5"" except the cramped last row. The Premium Economy seats have a pitch of 33"" and recline of 4.5"". Those extra couple of inches does make a huge difference. Reached Kolkata airport at about 6 am for my 7.05 am flight to Delhi. Had checked in online the previous night. Being a Platinum Member they offer complimentary lounge access. However, as happens often, there never is time to pop into the lounge. Went straight through security and to the boarding gate. Vistara boarding is always an organised affair. I really can't put a finger on what they do different but there never is the kind of melee that you see around boarding gates of most other airlines. They started boarding at 6.24 am. We were bussed to a distant stand. Quite a few minutes of bus ride. To a very far stand beyond the old terminal building. Now, if I have one complain with Vistara and indeed with most other airlines, is that the first flight out of the day is always from a non-aerobridge stand. The planes that come in late on the previous night are parked at stands away from the terminal. Every airline that does that, seems to avoid the expenditure of getting the aircraft to an aerobridge gate for the first flight out the next morning. Instead they subject you to an uncomfortable crowded bus ride. Vistara also does the same. Boarding was quick and orderly. The welcoming cold towel (hot in winters) is always a nice touch. Then they handed over the breakfast menu. Another nice touch. A round of water. Boarding complete and doors close at 6.50 am, well before scheduled 7.05 am departure. Then the Government owned Kolkata Airport's inefficiency took over. It wasn't till 7.06 am that we were pushed back. And another 10 mins odd before we were airborne. 20/25 mins on the ground after doors closed? I don't know who is to be blamed. I always enjoy the new planes, nice clean interiors, comfortable seats, the rather different purple and gold colour scheme. Even the cabin crew wear a purple and gold uniform. I always see the lady cabin crews wearing a similar metallic gold watch and pearl ear studs which go very well with the purple uniform. Haven't seen any other airline standardising the accessories that go with the uniform. That's a real neat touch. 30 mins into the flight and it was breakfast time. Meals are always a pleasure on Vistara. I am a hardcore non vegetarian but could not resist the Sabudana Khicdi and Medu Vada in Sambhar that morning with Starbucks coffee. Awesome. We were over Delhi well in time but were then a victim to the usual early morning congestion that's routine at Delhi. Inspite of that we were on the ground a couple of minutes earlier than the scheduled 9.25 am arrival. Aerobridge connected quickly and I was off the aircraft at 9.34 am. Very happy. Vistara seems to be setting a new bench mark in Indian domestic aviation. I sure do hope they maintain that standard.",Business,Premium Economy,10,5,5,5,,5,4,yes

Secondly, this airline is yet to be accommodated at the main airport, hence their flights land at a remote location, from where they stuff you in buses and get to the airport. Thirdly, drivers of these buses are ill mannered and untrained, despite it being very hot and supremely humid he refused to put the air conditioning on, despite all the passengers requesting, screaming and someone on the verge of fainting. Fourthly, delay in getting our luggage, it’s been over 40 minutes since we landed but no sign of our luggage! Never ever flying Vistara on this sector!",Business,Economy Class,3,4,4,4,,1,3,no

Got to Mumbai airport and went to call for a wheelchair from the phone outside the airport - all airlines listed except Vistara. That was odd. Had to then send a reluctant guard to call someone with a wheelchair. After that the flight was smooth. Check in and boarding etc all okay. Flight on time and they served a nice snack. Return was good with the flight on time and the Vistara service once again excellent. The crew on board and service is very good.

vistara,S Anand,2018-03-26,"✅ Trip Verified | The only flight in India which cares for its customers. I was flying Amritsar to Mumbai with Vistara. The flight got delayed by 3 hours approximately. I received sms regularly notifying me that the flight was delayed. We were offered meals at the airport, one move to compensate for the delay caused by them, which if you are travelling by any other airline, won't even offer a glass of water or juice. After entering the flight, the decor amazed me. We were again offered an in-flight meal, both the meals were delicious. Until the flight got ready for departure, every passenger received a personalised apology letter and to make up for this we were offered 10% discount vouchers for our next travel. I am sure any other airline wouldn't have even apologised for any delay. After getting down at Mumbai, my luggage got swapped with another flyer, the immediate response of the ground staff was commendable, they traced the customer and immediately and got the bags exchanged.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,10,5,5,5,,5,4,yes

Not difficult to tell that Singapore Airlines is involved as a partner in this airline. Check-in, boarding, and in-flight service were all superb.

The gentleman at check-in was extremely professional, courteous, and helpful, as were the rest of the staff. The aircraft was modern and clean. The only small downside on the whole flight was the fact that they run their own rewards program, rather than being integrated with existing international programs ie Flying Blue, or Star Alliance - hence after 15 flights so far this year, I have still only been credited with 13 of them.",Business,Economy Class,9,4,4,4,,5,4,yes
vistara,Vaibhav Shete,2018-02-13,✅ Trip Verified |  New Delhi to Mumbai. Flying with Vistara is a different experience altogether. Flying in UK963 from New Delhi to Mumbai was good. The staff was friendly. Even the flight attendants were helpful. Food option was both Veg and Non Veg servings. Local delicacies were served during the flight which is unique to Vistara. The plane was clean and tidy. The only con for the flight was a lack of In flight entertainment.,Business,Economy Class,8,5,5,5,2,5,4,yes

vistara,Sharma Umessh Kumar,2018-01-13,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Delhi. The food is included in fare with Vistara. It was Ekadasi from Hindu calendar, of course I follow this. Air hostess offered me khichdi food, after noticing that i told her that i can't eat khichdi. I believe that she understood that i don't want to eat Khichdi. So she offered me her food box, then i told her, today i can't eat rice in any form. She apologized & after some time some how she offered me some fruits & cookies to eat. Really appreciable for what she did on right time. I don't know whether airline trained air hostess for this or it was her initiative.

vistara,Souvik Das,2017-12-20,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to Mumbai. Vistara’s service is aimed at a premium overall appeal. The website interface is smooth, although the app could be better designed. Web check-in is smooth, and you don’t need to pay extra to pre-reserve a window/aisle seat of choice. Even spot check-in is easy, bag drops are always hassle free even in busy terminals like the T3 at New Delhi. The seats have comfortable leather. Leg and knee room is among the best, and you also get a coat hanger hook. However, no in-flight entertainment is a disappointment for a premium full-service airline. The food options are changing, and still remain decent. However, they were better when Vistara began, even though they still remain better than Jet Airways and Air India. The staff is very helpful and amiable, and  offer extra pillows and blankets. This was also the only domestic flight to offer a welcome drink in the Economy Class. Vistara is the best domestic airline in India in terms of quality, hospitality, cleanliness. The only thing really off-putting are the very few flights that they have right now even on popular routes, and the lacklustre Club Vistara membership programme.",Business,Economy Class,8,4,5,3,,5,3,yes
vistara,Usha Ganisetti,2017-11-18,"✅ Verified Review |  My parents travelled this morning with Vistara from Hyderabad to Delhi with connection to London via a different airline. The connection time we had between two flights was only 1 and half hours and we were made aware that the luggage had to be collected in Delhi and then checked-in again in the other airlines to London. As my parents were travelling for the first time, they started panicking as they do not have enough time to collect the luggage, got to the other airline desk for check-in , immigration and to the gate. But Vistara Airlines helped and checked in the luggage in business class so their luggage would come first and they can collect immediately when they come out.  They made my parents feel comfortable during that flight and arranged staff to assist them to reach the other flight on time with best support an airline can offer. Hats off to Team Vistara for such amazing support. ",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,10,5,5,5,,5,5,yes

My laptop trolley bag was 8kg and I was harassed to check in the luggage and not taking it by hand. I requested to their manager as well that this is the only bag and I have my laptop in bag, but of no use, they said either pay extra money or check in the baggage. Finally I have to take my laptop in my hand and check in the baggage. When tried to log in feedback at their site then their site doesn't take any feedback.

I am impressed with the quality of their training and attention to detail. Catering: Vegetarian option. Quite average tasting, a little bland.

I was not provided with any other alternate flight so had to book about three days before departure and it cost me a bomb. On the contrary my parents flew from Delhi to Goa by SpiceJet in February.

My travel Booking was from Srinagar to Bangalore under a single PNR. But Srinagar ground staff gave me boarding passes to Delhi only. Added to that they booked the checked in baggages to Delhi only. They wanted me to collect the luggages at Delhi, do a fresh check in for Bangalore flight. They did not allow the transfer facility at Delhi. I was inconvinienced a lot.

It's on time performance, new and clean aircraft, fantastic service, good food, etc has made it my favourite. The website and app is simple and user friendly. I am impressed with its frequent flyer programme where the points accrued seem to be more than other airlines. Staff are courteous and the systematic boarding gives a feel good factor right from the beginning of the journey. Food served is nice and hot.

The interior was fantastically decorated as well as well-maintained. The seats had a very soft cushioning which made us feel very comfortable. This was the first Indian airline whose seats were made up of leather. The legroom was also nice. The food tasted fantastic. I am very eager to fly Internationally with them.

vistara,Kevin Barrance,2017-01-22,✅ Verified Review |  Ahmedabad to Delhi. I was looking forward to flying on Vistara but it wasn't the greatest of experiences. First of all the flight was brought forward although this was due to restrictions in Delhi rather than Vistara's fault. Then because I had paid using an international credit card upon checking they said they would have to verify it before they could issue my boarding pass! I have never encountered this before so had to wait for about 15 minutes before they came and gave it to me. The flight itself took off and arrived some 45 minutes behind schedule. Seating was better than on Jet Airways domestic economy and the food served was OK for a short journey. Vistara seem to be offering a good product but it wasn't quite the positive experience I was hoping for.,Business,Economy Class,7,4,3,3,,2,3,yes

The menu card lists the calories of every item on offer. In my experience, Vistara is currently the best domestic airline in India, and by far.

The positives - decent ground staff, better than many airlines and leg space was better than regular low cost airline carriers. However, cabin staff couldn't speak proper English and forget smiling faces. Everything felt temporary. From the ground staff (outsourced) or the old leased planes. Food and beverages offered can extract a maximum value of 500INR on the ticket price. You could spend 500INR and get a much better meal in any of the other airline carriers. Their entire gameplay is premium but nothing spelt premium to me. At least in regular economy class. The flight was mid-afternoon and it became quite warm in the flight. Adding to the heat was the seats which were leather. We kept asking the flight attendants to reduce the temperature but to no avail.

The seats were unique and classy with leather covers and beautiful colours and winged adjustable headrests which we normally don't see on other Indian cariers in domestic flights. This is what makes Vistara more comfortable and I would definately prefer them over all other airlines in India. For me at the moment they are the best after the exit of Kingfisher in the past.

The cabin crew gave all pax a snack box with a juice, hot cutlet, chapati, cookies, face wipes, tomato ketchup and a bottle of water which was all very tasty. All in all it a wonderful experience.

vistara,M Theeran,2016-08-13,"✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to Delhi. Excellent service, hot food, Clean cabins and seats. Courteous and well dressed staff. I found it the best airline to fly in India and I hope they go international soon. They must provide inflight entertainment or a USB port on each seat.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,10,5,5,5,3,5,5,yes
vistara,Ravin Ramachandran Nair,2016-08-03,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Mumbai. Vistara turned out to be a pleasant experience for my first flight experience. I was booked on an Economy seat and contacted on the day prior to departure with an offer to purchase Premium Economy service at INR 3,000 per seat which was a good deal. Check-in staff at both New Delhi and Mumbai airports were efficient and warm. Very engaging staff members at the dedicated counter for Premium Economy passengers. 20kg checked in baggage and airline was quite generous with cabin baggage too. Luggage was tagged as 'Priority'. Premium Economy Passengers were invited to board through a dedicated lane at both airports. The fleet is maintained new, smells good and appears clean. Cabin crew were friendly, but like most Indian flight attendants they were too pre-occupied with their checks and service formalities and the graciousness of the flight attendants of Singapore Airlines was lacking. Nevertheless, the flight attendants seemed to be far ahead of their other Indian counterparts. Leg room in Premium Economy was definitely enhanced with what appeared to be a 35"" seat pitch. No in-flight entertainment on board, yet. Their in-fight magazine indicated that wireless streaming of entertainment is scheduled to launch shortly. Ample and interesting reading material was available on board. In-flight service included warm towels and great food presented well. On arrival at both airports, it was interesting to note that all the bags that came out first had the Priority Tag on. They seem to take their Priority tag business very seriously. Vistara is an excellent product in the Regional Indian Market and they have all the makings of a Skytrax 4 to 5 Star rating. The airline makes their competition looking like a bunch of novices in the business.",Business,Premium Economy,8,4,4,5,1,5,5,yes
vistara,Nandita Ahuja,2016-06-21,"✅ Verified Review | Delhi to Mumbai with Vistara in Premium Economy. My first experience was a good one.

vistara,D Hoover,2016-04-13,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Mumbai with Vistara. After a long time, this was first time that I really liked everything in a flight. Starting from the moment I checked in to actual flight, everything was just fabulous. The hostess was outstanding, the way she served drinks, food, etc and then collected garbage - looking through the seats for missed paper glasses left a decent impression with my wife and I. A pat for all the Vistara crew.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,10,5,5,5,,5,5,yes
vistara,P Dayal,2016-04-10,"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to Delhi with Vistara. Excellent checkin, flight, comfort, food, service and attitude. Wish other airlines learn from them in India. I was sceptical at first not having any experience of them but we needn't have worried. Came to know later that it it jointly belongs to the Tatas and Singapore Airlines - two excellent brands. Wish them well and hope they fly to more destinations.",Family Leisure,Premium Economy,9,5,5,4,,5,5,yes
vistara,Ankit Dubey,2016-04-08,"Delhi to Lucknow was my second time flying with Vistara, and it is one of the best airlines in India in terms of quality of staff, seating and their on time performance. The  best food in the Indian skies I believe and I love their fresh menu with amazing cuisines. I just hope Vistara adds IFE screens in their airplanes soon which it lacks. Their magazine is not that bad either. ",Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,9,5,5,5,,5,4,yes
vistara,Vikaas Kalantri,2016-03-13,"Mumbai to Delhi, and I feel that Vistara is next in class. The seat space, service, food and staff. This airline scores over other airlines in India for domestic travel. The only issue is that it doesnt fly to much routes or I would fly them more. Truly an amazing experience.",Business,Business Class,10,5,5,5,5,5,5,yes
vistara,Rudra Bhattacharya,2016-03-06,"Goa to Mumbai, and Vistara was a good experience for travelling with family, No hassle check-in and good leg space, Flight crew was courteous and in flight meal was provided for even a short 1 hour travel.

vistara,Atharva Agashe,2016-03-06,"Mumbai to Bengaluru. This was my third time flying with this airline, but this time my experience wasn't as good as I expected. The first was at the check-in where my luggage was overweight. I didn't mind paying but the charge per kg for excess luggage was quite high. The inflight service was very good, as the staff were very nice and friendly, and food served was delicious and was different from the last time I flew. Overall, the journey was satisfactory.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,6,5,5,5,,5,3,yes
vistara,Abhishek Ghamande,2016-02-29,"Flew Vistara for the first time in February from Delhi to Mumbai. Amazing experience. Loved the new aircraft, food and service. Truly value for money.

vistara,Samarendra Patra,2016-02-28,"Bhubaneswar to Delhi with Vistara. I had booked this flight just 1 day eelier and I had got a pretty good deal. The aircraft was new and fresh. They initiated boarding process before time which was good to see, there was no rush. They offered a choice from vegetarian and non-vegetarian breakfast. There were variety of beverages available: Tea and Coffee after the breakfast. Business Service at a price of an economy seat. But the seat was not comfortable to the extent as was expected from a TATA brand.  Still I recommend Vistara.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,8,3,5,4,5,5,5,yes
vistara,Shivam Negi,2016-02-23,"Mumbai to Delhi with Vistara. I had booked this flight 20 hrs before my travel and I had got a pretty good deal. During check-in I was informed that I have been upgraded to Premium Economy, which was a delight. The aircraft was new and fresh. The boarding was so calm, as they had initiated boarding process before time which was good to see, there was no rush.  The seat was comfortable. There were Two vegetarian and one non-vegetarian choice. I took the Oriental choice which was fab. Ras Malai and Green Salad were on the sides. There were variety of beverages available. Tea and Coffee after the meal. It was Business at a price of an economy seat. I recommend Vistara's Premium Economy.",Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,10,5,5,5,,5,5,yes
vistara,Satya Tripathi,2016-02-14,"Bhubaneswar to Delhi, and I have flown Vistara thrice by now, and their service quality is consistently better than other airlines in India.

vistara,Rishad Patell,2016-02-10,"Vistara flight from Delhi to Mumbai. Check in was very smooth with many open counters at Delhi T3. Flight was delayed 20 minutes and we were kept informed. Boarding very quick and efficient. Seats in economy seem better than most domestic carriers. Aircraft clean. Food served included a nice chicken with noodles, corn salad and dessert- quite nice. Tea/Coffee service after the meal. Pilot updates were frequent and the flight got in only 10 minutes late. Bags on belt as soon as we got there.

vistara,Renu Bhalla,2016-01-22,"Bangalore to New Delhi with Vistara, and I was travelling with my husband. We had booked the tickets on premium economy, but to our surprise we were bumped up to business class. I have to say this it is one of the best airlines in India. I was quite impressed by their service, on the ground and in the air. Too bad they don't have a lounge yet.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,10,5,5,5,4,5,5,yes
vistara,Puneesh Makhija,2016-01-08,"Delhi to Bangalore flight UK889. The flight was delayed by 5 hours due to dense fog. It was supposed to take-off at 6:25 am, but we finally took-off at 11:35 am.  At close to 7:30 am, they requested the customers to go to food court and have breakfast. It was just Dosa or Pudi. I was under impression that complimentary breakfast was over. Though, when we boarded the flight at 8:30, again they served the proper breakfast. The flight could not move by 9:30 as it was in queue. Again, close to 10:00 am they served Cookies and Juice. Though, the flight was delayed for 5 hours, crew member and staff made sure that people were always informed and server well. I will definitely prefer Vistara next time.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,9,5,5,5,,5,5,yes
vistara,Prayash Giria,2016-01-07,"Mumbai to Delhi return and upgraded to Vistara premium economy on outbound (greater legroom, priority boarding, baggage first-out). By far the most courteous staff and crew, and the best in-flight catering on a domestic Indian flight. Spacious enough, and seats were not uncomfortable. Flights were delayed both times. They should roll out inflight entertainment, or cut fares.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,6,3,5,5,,5,2,yes
vistara,Prayash Giria,2016-01-07,"Mumbai to Delhi return on peak hour flights. Premium economy on the outbound, economy on the inbound. Flights were delayed, and had no in-flight entertainment. However, crew and ground staff are very courteous (one offered us an upgrade). Premium Economy gets you extra legroom, dining choices, priority boarding and deplaning, and baggage first-out, but unless they get their IFE act sorted, its not worth the price. Economy is regular, but with pleasing staff and good food (better so than Premium Economy). Again, at the price point, a little IFE and more baggage allowance should be included.",Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,6,3,5,5,1,5,3,yes
vistara,Rohit Raj,2015-12-28,"Delhi to Mumbai. Vistara is a relatively a new airline which gives you a full-service carrier within Indian skies. Its services are good with good choice of food, attentive and helpful ground and inflight staff, clean aircraft with decent legroom. The only thing it lacks is the IFE which is not available. Overall, a customer friendly airline.",Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,9,4,5,4,,4,4,yes
vistara,A Basu,2015-12-04,"Vistara is a new airline and they do some things well. There is good leg room, boarding is by seat number and works well. The food is so-so. However, I have taken the evening flight from Bangalore to Delhi three times, and it has been late each time. It appears to be a regular thing on this route, the staff is unconcerned and seem like they are used to it. ",Business,Economy Class,5,5,4,3,,4,4,no
vistara,Mikhil Sanghvi,2015-11-26,"This was a refreshing experience. Being Upgraded from Premium Economy to Business was a nice touch. The cabin crew in charge of business class were warm, friendly and professional. The seats were spacious and comfortable with a generous legroom. However, contrary to their website, no IFE tablets were distributed. But that is fine for a 40 minute flight. Welcome drinks were offered followed by a choice of two vegetarian and one non vegetarian meals. The dessert was delicious. Two oshiboris were distributed. Chocolates were given too. Impressive enough for a 40 minute flight.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,9,5,5,5,2,4,5,yes
vistara,Rajan Parrikar,2015-11-20,"Flew Vistara in Business Class twice in the last month, from Mumbai to Goa and then back.

vistara,Shivam Negi,2015-09-26,"My third Vistara flight and using Premium Economy this time. The fare difference was not much in comparison with Economy. At Ahmedabad there was a separate check-in for Premium Economy and luggage was tagged with Priority Tag. Boarding was sequential, though it was amusing that it was Business first, then economy and then Premium Economy. Water, cold towel and juice were offered. The seats are comfortable, and the seat pocket contents are stocked up with newspapers. The crew were warm and professional. There were food two choices for Veg and one for Non-Veg. The choices were well explained to the passenger. Vegetarian choices there were pepper paneer tikka pizza and cheese macaroni and for non-veg egg and chicken pastry accompanied with potato Vada with sweet and spiced Yoghurt dressing and Coffee Mousse. For a 1 hour Flight this was great. ",Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,10,5,5,4,,5,5,yes

Being a new carrier, the crew were very professional. The food was awesome including a chicken pizza/ vegetable wrap with pineapple bravorias and Mumbai jhurmuri chaat. Being a short 50 min sector they served a good meal. A great airline to fly.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,9,5,5,4,,4,4,yes
