china airlines,Tim Gould,2020-04-05,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Brisbane via Taipei. Hong Kong to Taipei was Ok, service was reasonable. Taipei to Brisbane was uncomfortable and food selection was poor. While in Australia China Airlines cancelled the return leg Taipei to Hong Kong. I made 2 phone calls and 1 email to their Taipei office explaining that I still wanted to continue with the Brisbane to Taipei leg. Before the flight I received and email stating the refund would be HK$ 4055. At Brisbane I was advised by China Airlines staff to make my own ongoing arrangements. After there flight I received another email saying the refund was now HK$ 460, which is 3.7% of the ticket cost.

china airlines,Joshua Lok,2020-03-23,"✅ Trip Verified |  Jakarta to Vancouver via Taipei. First time flying on China Airlines after Expedia mistakenly cancelled our Air Canada booking. We were impressed with the aircraft which looked new and most up to date entertainment system. Our family enjoyed the food, even our children finished their meals and they're picky. What I was most impressed with was their customer service and ability to help us change flights in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic that occurred while we were away. Due to closing borders where we were scheduled to be on our way back home, we had to change our flight to a direct flight back home and we wanted to leave as early as possible. We could get never get through to Expedia at all (after hours on the phone) but China Airlines customer service was more than helpful and they were able make our changes for us and get us home even though we booked through Expedia. Next time I travel to Asia, I would consider China Airlines as a top choice carrier. ",Family Leisure,First Class,10,4,5,5,5,5,5,yes
china airlines,Julie Ross,2020-03-17,"✅ Trip Verified |  Myself my mother and my husband flew Gatwick to Sydney via Taipei with China Airlines but will never fly with them again. The cabin crew on the first leg of the journey did not speak hardly at all. We could not hear nor understand the announcements so in an emergency it would have been guess work which I find astounding but in general I think its poor customer service. The food was just awful, I know it was 95% Chinese passengers but I think the airline should look at the list of people and cater for those who don't want to eat soggy rice and chicken on both the inbound and outbound flights. The blankets provided were a dirty mustard colour and were way past their use date. The cabin crew all were wearing face masks to protect themselves and passengers but found it totally unhygienic that they wiped down the toilet floors, units and toilet with paper towels and no gloves on, that to me was not only disgusting but a health and safety issue. Overall we all found our experience with China Airlines a very poor one. Never again to be repeated.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,3,1,1,1,2,3,no
china airlines,J Francisco,2020-03-11,"✅ Trip Verified |  They have no regard for consumer rights and will destroy your itinerary if they dont have enough passengers. Booked a flight for my wife, 3yr old and myself, directly with China Airlines via their webpage for a flight from Singapore to Takamatsu. This included a layover of 20hrs in Taipei which we also booked a nights stay at a hotel for. 1 month prior to departure they brought forward by a day, our TPE to TAK flight. As they did not change the Singapore to TPE flight the connection is now impossible. They rectified the problem by changing our SIN to TPE flight a day earlier but refused to make up for our lost hotel booking. We rebooked our hotel at our own cost. 11 days before departure, they changed our TPE to TAK flight again bringing it forward by 24hrs and again neglecting to make the appropriate amendment for SG to TPE. They have also again refused to compensate us in any way for having to book a hotel for the 3rd time. Warning! It looks cheap and respectable. It is a lie.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,,,,,,1,no
china airlines,Stephan Stegner,2020-02-18,"✅ Trip Verified |  The check-in in this case was a bit more complex, because my flight ability in Taipei had to be obtained through a stay in China. However, this can be assessed as positive for the health of other passengers. Departures and arrivals were on time. The A330 made a somewhat older impression and the seat pitch was below average.

china airlines,N Huang,2020-02-12,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ho Chi Minh city to Frankfurt via Taipei, a good experience overall. I departed at 05:45 p.m., and meals were served 3 times, 1 dinner in the connecting flight from HCMC to Taipei and 2 on the flight from Taipei to Frankfurt. The food was good, but there were not many options and the menu was the same for both departing and returning flights. The crew were friendly and caring, they noticed when I felt uncomfortable due to low temperature inside the cabin and offered hot drinks. The seat was comfortable. I'm a rather small girl (162cm in height), so I had no problem with legroom, but it might have been a bit cramped for some other passengers around me. My returning date was a busy day for Frankfurt airport, so I had a delayed takeoff, which made me miss my connecting flight from Taipei to HCMC. I had a long delay at Taoyuan airport. The airlines handled the situation well, they offered me to stay in their lounge and took care of my baggage, coupons for food and bevarage were also given.

china airlines,Han Ly,2020-01-08,"Not Verified |  Taipei to Frankfurt. I am really upset about China Airline customer service and the abuse of regulations. I book my tickets via Expedia, and Expedia asks their users to input the names as: Family name, Middle Name, First Name. I input as it asks and they arrange my name as Western Order by Family name First Name Middle Name. This is a common way, even western government department does this to Asian name order. When I booked my ticket, Expedia forwarded my info to China Airline and I got charged 100€ for changing my name on the tickets. I booked through Expedia all the time with other Airlines and there has been no problem. With the pressure in the airport, I had to pay. Later I contact China Airline with this complaint and they act like this is my fault. That is really ignorant attitude from China Airlines. I explained to them in details, and they were pushing the problems to their regulation and Expedia. I am sure this is a systematic problem between Expedia and China Airlines, however the customer is the one that is blamed and paid the money. They reject my claim and complaint and complaint but doesn’t do better than abusing their regulations towards customers.

china airlines,D Gurlan,2019-12-21,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Taipei. I fail to understand why this flight and the return leg arrived at and departed from Terminal 2. The ticket specifies Terminal 1, Immigration and baggage delivery are at Terminal 1 and the return check-in is at Terminal 1. This is not the first time this has happened on a CI flight. So why does CI not have proper facilities in Terminal 2 or mark the ticket information as Terminal 2? As far as I am aware, on arrival at TPE there was no announcement on the aircraft and no printed announcement on the video monitors. Passengers were therefore left with a weakly written and seemingly unimportant sign on exiting the Gate ramp. But a China Airlines attendant stood right in front and in the middle of that sign rendering it impossible to read. And her main job seemed to be to direct passengers en route to a soon departing Fukuoka flight since the Bangkok flight had arrived late. The only sign exiting passengers can easily see is the bright illuminated sign above stating that for Immigration passengers should turn right. That, though, is for Terminal 2 Immigration and baggage claim. The handwritten sign that should be in very large thick clear lettering easily visible to all disembarking passengers pointed out that those going to Terminal 1 should actually turn left and then walk a very long way. A staff member giving instructions in Chinese is of little use to those not conversant in the language! Having been caught out by this once before and wasted almost an hour, after this flight I stopped and took time to check the sign carefully. This unthought-through action apart, the flight was smooth and the meal very tasty. My only other gripe about China Airlines is the headphones for the IFE. It makes available the ancient circular ones. I accept these fit nicely into the ears of a majority of passengers. But not all ears are the same and they just don’t fit mine at all. So even though this, with a weather delay, was only a 4-hour flight, watching anything on the IFE was out of the question.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,6,3,4,4,1,4,5,yes

china airlines,Anurag Dave,2019-12-03,"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Denpasar via Taipei. Check-in at LAX was smooth. They gave us a transfer sleeve to store boarding passes for later segment, which was a nice touch. We had a remote gate far away and had to be shuttled by bus. That experience wasn't very pleasant as we had to wait inside the bus for a very long time. Despite having reservation for four seats (traveling as a family), there was no available overhead storage. All four of us had requested special meals, but the flight attendants started serving us regular meal. It was only after we showed them our boarding passes that they served our special meals. The overall ambiance, seating comfort, and IFE were excellent. Both B777-300ER and A330-300 were tastefully decorated. The service between Taipei and Bali segment was far superior to what we experience between LA and Taipei. The service on our final segment from TPE to LAX fell below the mark. The flight attendants serving us in economy didn't smile and were quite rude while interacting with us. So, while friendly service was absent in TPE-LAX segment, the WiFi worked well on B777-300ER. Overall, China Airlines offered an inconsistent experience where the positives outweighed the negatives, so we will still fly with them again.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,7,5,2,5,5,4,4,yes

china airlines,M Peale,2019-11-14,"✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Taipei. This is the worst flight I've ever been on in my life.  I got a discount on this flight, and the stewardesses were nice. Everything else about was a nightmare. I called a week in advance and had to pay for the desired seat I wanted for $30 extra because this airline doesn't let you choose your seat. But they ended up giving me the wrong seat anyway, rather than 40E, which is larger. They could not fix the issue on the plane, so I was stuck with the tiny seat and wasted my $30. Some seats can lift the armrest, but the one I had to go to could not and was quite uncomfortable. I then learned that this was the first flight I've been on that doesn't offer free WiFi. I had to pay $50 (specifically $43.90) to use their very bad WiFi service. The ""entertainment"" tablet doesn't work, even if you rub it or clean it, and there's nothing on there you've ever heard of, anyway. The food looked inedible, but that's okay because I opted not to eat anyway. It just sucks you have to pay for water, since TSA obviously doesn't let you bring any liquids on. Guess I should've brought a bigger water bottle.  Sixteen hours of this, and they don't even offer you WiFi or working power outlets (though I'm surprised we even had those). This airline just seems cheap, even if their actual prices aren't that cheap. ",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,3,1,5,2,1,3,3,no

china airlines,R Marsden,2019-10-16,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Honolulu via Taipei. I fly regularly between Honolulu and Bangkok, but I've never flown on China Airlines. However, it emerged as the least-expensive option for a recent trip and since the price and flight schedules were good I decided to give the airline a try, despite some hesitation. I was mostly pleasantly surprised by the airline: Though the staff seem to be unable to smile and service both on the ground and in the air is bare-bones, the A350 is a fabulous aircraft, the seats were mostly comfortable, and the entertainment system was alright. There were a few negative experiences: For instance, not one single flight arrived or departed on time; The airline's pillows and blankets are pitiful, and the catering is mostly inedible; China Airlines has the serving style favored by many Asian airlines, wherein a few drinks choices are offered on top of the meal service trolleys, and if a passenger requests anything not on top of the trolley, the flight attendants tend to lie and say they ran out. It's very, very tedious to constantly have to ask and remind them for something as simple as a can of Coke Zero, and for it to be brought with a scowl. I arrived at Taipei from Honolulu in the middle Typhoon Mitag; My onward flight to Bangkok that evening was cancelled and I was expecting a chaotic, uncomfortable evening in Taipei's airport. Much to my surprise, the situation had been rather expertly arranged before my arrival: An agent met our flight and informed all of us going to Bangkok that we had been rescheduled for a flight the following morning and that accommodation had been arranged for us for that evening. I was impressed by the efficiency of China Airlines and the Taipei airport authorities, and I commend them for their handling of a difficult situation. In all, I recommend China Airlines because of the very low cost paid for this set of flights. While China Airlines certainly pales in comparison to ANA, JAL, EVA Air, Thai Airways and Singapore Airlines, it is at least as good as Korean Air.",Business,Economy Class,6,4,3,3,4,3,4,yes
china airlines,J Hasem,2019-10-10,"✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Vancouver. The onboard experience was fine. The problem with this airline is the ground customer service and code-share system. I have no idea why, but China Airlines would not allow me to select my seats in advance or even change my seats at check-in. It seems that some tickets simply do not have an online check-in or seat selection option. You are forced to get to the check-in desk when it opens (about 3hrs before a flight) and try to get them to change the seat they assign to you. This creates a mad rush at check-in, and a strong likely-hood of not sitting with your companion and getting the middle seat. This is exactly what happened to me in Taipei. I flew in on a code-share flight with Vietnam Airlines. There was no online check-in option for the China Airlines portion of the flight. At check-in in Saigon, China Airlines automatically assigned my wife and me to two middle seats in different rows (not together). I asked the Vietnam Airlines agent if we could change the seat assignments, but they were unable to access seating for China Airlines. When I got to Taipei for the connection, I went to the China Airlines office to change the seats, and they said all seats were assigned and the flight was full, but that the boarding counter could probably do something. I went to the boarding gate, and they said they would make a note of this. I asked what that meant, and they said they would tell the stewardess. I asked what that meant, and they said the stewardess would look for spare seats. I asked why they couldn't see if there were any spare seats, and the boarding gate said they could, and there were none, 'but maybe someone would be too sick to fly'. There was no attempt to look for people that were willing to move from one seat to another to accommodate my wife and I sitting together. No effort what so ever, they just wanted to tell me they took my name. The boarding agents said it was a common problem that people could not check-in online or select their seats in advance. The boarding agents even laughed as I walked away. The problem is not just the boarding agents, its China Airlines inability to allow online check-in or seat selection on booking flights. I'm not sure why they don't have a system that would do this? Regardless, I will not fly with this airline again.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2,4,4,4,4,1,3,no

Vienna to Taipei I was offered to change my original seat to a seat in a row which was completely free (I did manage to sleep a couple of hours on this flight as I could kind of lie down during the flight.) The remaining two flights were fully booked and if 3 men sit next to each other, there is not too much space in Economy class but it did not feel uncomfortable.

Felt like a harrasment because I purchased a premium economy seats for my infant and have to argue back and forth about it because they didn't believe my 1,5 year old is not 2 years old, I bought 3 premium economy seats for my 2 kids and I but they only gave me 2 meals and not counting my other kid! Their excuse is they don't have infant food even tho I told them my 1,5 year old can eat anything, asking me to show my kid passport all the time because they thought my 1,5 year old is too big for her age. Told me to deflate my flytot even tho other passengers in economy class are allowed to using theirs, even after I deflated it they keep coming back and woken me up because they thought I was still using it! I have to literally show them I didn't use the flytot anymore!  Again I will never fly with China airlines ever again. The only reason I gave 2 stars for cabin service and not 1 star is because one of the flight attendant actually felt bad for keep asking me about my child.

china airlines,C Barkanas,2019-08-19,"✅ Trip Verified |  China Airlines has the worst customer service and support. We booked a round trip from Singapore to Vancouver last week. Our flight got cancelled due to a typhoon in Taipei and we got to know of it just a day before we were suppose to fly. There was no way to reach out to the airlines - no helpline 24*7. It was a struggle to contact the airline and we wrote on their Facebook page on which they responded. They asked to wait and asked to visit the airport next day morning. Got there early morning and they blatantly said they can’t do anything! Flight is cancelled and no replacement to fly. We were told there is one flight which was on very short notice and we coudnt have possibly taken it! With no way out we booked another flight to do our trip paying a lot more extra. We reached Vancouver and were continuously getting messages from China Airlines for our return flight which made us comfortable that our outgoing flight is on! To our horror, we were stopped from boarding the flight! And then came in the China Airlines supervisor who broke some news to us which none bothered to convey till then by the airlines. First he said if you board the flight you can’t get refund for the incoming flight which we technically did use. Yes, we couldn't use because you cancelled the flight and did not give any backup flight to the helpless customer. None of the customer service people at the airport told us about the refund and cancellation in such scenarios. Zero communication. The supervisor blatantly asked to decide whether to board and forget the refund for one way or buy another ticket and take a full refund. We were aghast. This isn’t just a monetary situation but a big mental pressure for someone travelling with family. The airline showed no sympathy towards the child too. To convey the same we went to one of the representatives and they kinda looked lost had no idea and then directed us to someone else, laughing at out back. This is ridiculous and shows the airline lacks basic human courtesy! A little later the supervisor came and said That we can't board the flight altogether! Since the ticket stands null and void! None from the airlines conveyed us till now and instead we were getting all flight updates on messages. Is it a technical problem that your system shows customer wrong information and you the right information? We coudnt sleep looking for another pocket friendly Flight to go Home and hotel to stay.

china airlines,C Jones,2019-08-19,"✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Brisbane via Taipei. Extremely good experience! Firstly terrific value for money as this similar trip with Turkish Airlines or Singapore Airlines was going to cost over double the price of China Airlines! Ground staff were helpful and efficient, lounge in Taipei was great and cabin crew service was friendly yet not overbearing. The food on all sectors was terrific with plenty of variety in the meals across all 4 sectors - I always chose to eat rather than sleep since I didn't want to miss the meal! Seats are very comfortable and happily got all the sleep I could. Both the B777 and A350 were enjoyable although the A350 is the newer and better product. I was worried about my bags as I also had a flight before Frankfurt but both bags happily made it through all 6 flights without being lost or damaged. Only negatives are that the entertainment system is a bit limited with about 50% of the movies in English with few of them particularly recent and the selection is poorly organised, especially compared to someone like Emirates, but in Business Class it was easy to sleep rather than watch a movie - this would be a bigger problem in Economy where it's harder to get good sleep. Also their flight schedule can lead to some long transit layovers in Taipei and they make too many announcements in the lounge, which was especially unnecessary when a small delay of 20 minutes on my flight was communicated to me via text, email and a lounge attendant even came and found me personally to let me know! So many announcements affected the atmosphere a bit and made it hard to rest.

china airlines,Albany Wong,2019-08-08,"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Bangkok via Taipei return. All 4 flights  were nothing short of exemplary, operated by an A350, which is much quieter and noticeably reduces jet lag. The crew on all my flights were friendly, professional and very safety conscious. Meal service was prompt and with a smile, and the crew were polite and friendly. I ordered several drinks and requested a toothbrush and an adapter and all were delivered quickly. They passed out hot towels for economy class passengers which is a much-appreciated gesture. During the overnight flight staff often passed through the cabin with water and juice, and kept the toilets clean. My flight back to Melbourne was delayed by 8 hours and we were provided accommodation at the Novotel near Taipei airport and they organised a shuttle bus to take us back to the airport in the morning, I found the ground staff at Taipei airport to be friendly and customer focused. The onboard entertainment system is easy to navigate and had many new releases and TV shows to choose from. The only aspect that could be improved is their food options, I found most of my meals to be lacking flavor, however they did offer an ice cream bar and a bread roll with all meals. Staff offer a selection of juice soft drinks, wine and coffee/Chinese tea with the meal service.

The back seat design lacks enough forethought in not making available slots for tablets and mobile phones and a hook for small items to hang. Having said that there is good legroom space. The entertainment choice is still limited. The flight crew service was better than the ICN-TPE leg but they lack the courteousness that other Asian airlines are known for. One example, one flight attendant told a passenger to bring the seat back upright for a meal. She was quite rude and abrupt. For a Chinese her manner would have been viewed as a typical request, but as a flight attendant serving passengers of various nationalities, that would not be acceptable. She looked as if she was one of the more senior member of the flight crew. The food was still below average and the flight attendants were once again rushing through the meal service offering coffee and tea even though passengers had not finished the main meal. Overall, they lack the expected attention to detail and professionalism to compete effectively with other airlines.

The meal service was rushed with coffee and tea being offered even before most could finish the meal and in a rushed manner that if you were not paying attention you would have missed them. The IFE is an old outdated 6.5"" touch screen that is due for an update with relatively limited choice of entertainment. The pillows and blankets were not separately packaged raising questions of possible sanitation. The food quality is below average.

china airlines,C Garmin,2019-07-29,"✅ Trip Verified |  Manila to Vancouver via Taipei. My overall experience is okay. Needs further improvement on the audio. Also, the food should be improved, aesthetically and by flavor. Our taste buds aren’t much functional when in high altitude, so it is a must that aroma and flavor of the food compliments each other, or else, all of the food will just taste all pretty much the same. I had a bad experience in my baggage when the ground steward in Manila told me that my baggage will go straight to Saskatoon (my final destination), and not to be picked up in Vancouver. Since I was a new flyer, I didn’t know much of this. I even clarified (twice) with the steward if I will be picking it up in Saskatoon or Vancouver, and he kept on saying that it’s gonna be in Saskatoon. But when I arrived in Saskatoon, my baggage wasn’t there. So much inconvenience on my part. They need to have well-trained and knowledgeable staff when it comes to these types of situation, or a mentor should be around in this case.

Both check-in processes were efficient and friendly. The lounges in Melbourne, Taipei and Sapporo were comfortable without being luxurious - good spaces to relax, with pleasant food and drink options. On board, the seats turned into nice lie-flat beds, the main downside being a lack of storage space around the seats. The crews were hardworking, polite and generally friendly. Only soft drinks were offered as a welcome, but there was a reasonable wine and spirits list. My vegetarian meals were fine but not adventurous. No amenities kits were provided, and there were no toothbrushes/paste provided in the toilets -- a sign of some cutting of corners in this product.

EVA operates an A330 with 2-2-2 in business class on this route but China Airlines operates an A350-900 with a 1-2-1 and what a stunning cabin this is probably the nicest business class cabin I have travelled. With a late departure around 2250 from Brisbane and an arrival into Taipei at 0545 the next morning with just under 9 hours in the air the quick meal service on departure was well organized and excellent quality which left a reasonable amount of time for some sleep before breakfast before arrival in Taipei. The seat on this plane is fantastic with plenty of storage a great screen and a very sturdy table that pulls out from under the screen and always have a little part exposed so is always a handy shelf at anytime. The finishes that they have used seem to be of a really high quality with my 16 month old plane looking like it was on its first flight.

china airlines,P Reeve,2019-04-27,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Taipei. I had an extremely bad experience with China Airlines, and request some answers from them. We bought tickets mid February for return tickets : Hong Kong – Taiwan (flight CI 922). At check-in, the morning of the flight, the staff simply told us that we couldn’t take our flight. Besides generating a huge frustration feeling before our holidays even start, the fact that she didn’t propose any solution or even look for solution is simply astonishing. So the reason she gave us is that our names on the booking didn’t match our passports. To be precise, our First Name was correct, and our Family Name was also correct. BUT, she told me that we had to put all our middle names as well with our First Names. Apparently, this is a change in the policy that was pushed before, but she was not able to tell us how recently. And as we did not put our middle names, our tickets were unusable, we couldn’t take the plane. Everything else was correct : passport number, dates, etc. No solution proposed, no real help, nothing… Oh wait, actually yes, she proposed us a solution : buy new tickets, obviously ! In my country, the middle names are absolutely never used. Moreover, every time I didn’t put our middle names in the booking, all the companies let us go on the plane. But China Airlines only decided not to. So I tried to find a solution, any action we could do to amend it. Of course, modifying the booking online by myself was prohibited by China Airlines website. I went back on the website to check the display of the booking page, and where this rule is written. So actually there is now a mention in brackets to put middle names (which I don’t remember to see last time, anyway). However, there are only 2 boxes called “Last Name” and “First Name”. If you require middle names too, add a dedicated box, it is clearer. On top of that, my first name contains an hyphen, but the website does not accept it. Moreover, I have commas between my middle names, but as the website does not accept special characters neither, how to input them ? Finally, where there is a change in policy, you should make it more obvious ! The technical limitations of the website make everything even more confusing. So at the counter I asked her to amend our booking; not possible neither. How come ?? Wait, actually, yes, she could modify the booking, but ONLY 3 LETTERS… What ? yes, 3 letters. So she managed to amend our son’s booking as the middle name was only 3 letters long (of course, with a fee), but not ours… What of a rule is this ? So actually, China Airlines CAN amend booking. Technically and regulatory, it is possible(I presume China airlines will use some kind of dark regulation to explain that only 3 letters can be changed for security purposes…) They just didn’t for us. So we finally bought new tickets, with fees, more expensive of course. I made reimbursement request for the old ones, and of course, no answer yet. And I don’t expect any. Better have customers paying twice and not losing money, right China airlines ? At Taipei counter, I told China Airlines staff my story, and ask them if they could amend our names, they replied “yes it should be possible to amend”, “hum, I don’t understand why they told you that in Hong Kong, I am not sure why”.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,3,3,2,,1,1,no

The 2nd segment (New York to Boston) was carried by JetBlue. When I contacted China Airlines to get refund for the 2nd segment, they told me that JetBlue did something to the ticket so they can't process the ticket in their system right now. I asked China Airlines to talk directly to JetBlue, but they wouldn't do it. They kept asking me to translate their issues for them although I don't even know some of the terminology used. And each time when I called back to China Airlines, I got connected to a different rep so I had to repeat my story and tell the 2nd rep about what the first rep told me and what JetBlue told me. These went on for 4 rounds. Each round, I had to explain more, why there need to be a refund, what the 1st rep said, what JetBlue replied, what the 2nd rep said, etc. It is an unbelievably bad customer service. Finally, somehow they were able to process it and told me they'd contact me about the refund. Few days later, I got an email from China airline telling me that yes, they could refund me now, but I'll need to personally go to a China Airlines office, which is in a completely different state, far from the state I live to get this refund! I was very furious and replied by asking who would pay the airfare for me to fly to another state to get this refund in person and why couldn't they simply refund the money back to the credit card I used to purchased the tickets in the first place.

china airlines,Scott Carlton,2019-01-09,"Not Verified |  San Francisco to Bangkok via Taipei. The seats on their 777-300 and A350 are excellent, wide and full lie-flat, and decent blanket. The seats are sturdy, so you can't feel movement by other passengers in neighboring seats getting up and down. Amenities are decent, and the cabin staff is attentive. Overall, though, this is at best a middling business-class product. Unlike other airlines, you don't get Champagne before departure, just a choice of apple juice, orange juice, or water. In-flight entertainment options are quite limited, with many movies and TV shows available only in Chinese. The food tends to be merely edible, and seldom appetizing or enjoyable. It's beyond me why they charge business class passengers for WiFi - there's nothing like paying upwards of $5000 for a single ticket, trying to log on to WiFi, and finding that you need to pay extra for WiFi access. As for ground service, China Airlines lounges are notoriously bleak. They're often quite crowded, and the food and beverage choices are ridiculously limited. (In Taipei, for example, they have 4-5 dim sum varieties on offer, some congee, and a couple of other Chinese offerings, such as a cabbage stir-fry dish. At the SFO lounge, the choices are vastly more limited. You'll get far better food outside in the terminal.)

china airlines,J Sibal,2019-01-06,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to Manila via Taipei.  All 4 segments of our flights went relatively well, there were no hassles and the fare we paid was good especially since this was for Christmas peak season. The San Francisco-Taipei and Taipei-San Francisco flights both were excellent but the Taipei-Manila and Manila-Taipei were okay. SFO-TPE: Check-in was a breeze and there were no hassles with the luggage although we were slightly overweight by a fraction. The B777-300ER plane we flew looks fairly new. We got seats 71H & 71K - perfect for couples. Food was good, service was decent. There were lots of entertainment options, movies, etc. and monitor was huge and resolution was sharp. Toilet was clean and I was told flight crew periodically clean it/wipe it down, which was well appreciated. They exceeded my expectations. TPE-MNL: We had 1.5 hours of transit time but lines were very long through security. Aircraft was A330 with a 2-4-2 configuration. We loved the fact that we were seated on a pair of seats as we like to keep to ourselves. Service was decent, nothing exceptional. Food was okay. There were some entertainment options on board including movies but since this was a 2-hour flight, it was not enough to finish a complete movie. The aircraft was also older and the monitor was smaller and not as sharp than the B777-300ER. MNL-TPE: Same aircraft as TPE-MNL with similar experience. My only unfavorable comment was that restrooms weren't clean on this flight. Some passenger completely made a mess in the entire lavatory and it appears flight crew do not clean this, possibly because it was a very short flight. TPE-SFO: Similar comments as CI003 SFO-TPE. We were seated on 70H & 70K. We really loved the pair of seats in the back. Again, food and service were excellent. No transit issues as we purposely took the 11-hour layover to see the city. However, immigration line took 1.5 hours - not good. Otherwise, the experience was good. Overall we were very pleased with our experience. Flights were on time, products and services were good, luggage came as expected and there were no significant inconveniences/hassles.

Early the next morning we were served breakfast; I chose an omelette which came with fruit and yoghurt. The breakfast was tasty, though not as good as dinner. Arrival in Sydney was slightly early thanks to a strong tailwind, so we had to wait about ten minutes for our gate to be vacated by another aircraft. The legroom in economy was generous.

As a bonus, clearing immigration at SFO, reclaiming our bags, and getting our hire-car were painless. Touchdown at 17:47, on our way at 19:15. The same process took us well over 3 hours a few years ago. They lost points for the wi-fi (too unreliable to be of any use) and the Sydney and Taipei lounges (reasonable, but more functional than welcoming with okay but not great food).

china airlines,Aiyaphol Kemapuckpong,2018-12-08,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Fukuoka via Taipei. I booked China airlines as they were quite cheap. Check in was quick for the flight from Bangkok to Taipei, and this flight was 25% full, so everyone spread out and was comfortably seated. Boarding was smooth. I changed to an exit row after the doors closed, so no complaints on legroom. Seats were quite plush. This was a newer A330 and the seat had a touchscreen TV, USB charging point and a shared power outlet. Food on most of the flights were of good quality, although I went for the less appealing option half the time! The flight attendants were courteous and friendly. Service was relatively quick. On the flight to Fukuoka, we had a 45 minute connection, and walking distances can be quite long through Taipei Airport, so we were some of the last passengers to board. This flight used a 737 Sky Interior, which I must say has the worst bathroom.  This aircraft did not come with personal TVs but it's understandable as the flight lasted less than two hours. On the return flight, I flew from Osaka on their 777-300ER. On this flight, Premium economy was sold as standard economy, so I jumped at the opportunity and managed to get front-row seats for me and my mum. The premium economy seats look fantastic, have plenty of privacy, but I wouldn't choose them for a long haul transpacific flight. This is as the recline isn't too plenty and the hard backrest itself is a bit impractical.  On flights to Japan, I highly recommend their Sapporo beer. It's the best can of beer I've had in the sky! On the flight to Bangkok, it was an older A330 this time and didn't feature power outlets or usb ports, and the seat recline was broken on many seats, so it would recline or not stay reclined at some points on the flight.

So we are sitting in the plane 3 hours after “scheduled departure time” with 0 notice, reimbursement or options.

The flight arrived at the terminal just a few minutes late. There had been the usual pre-landing announcements but these were totally inaudible as the purser clearly had never checked the volume. Deplaning there was one China Airlines employee at the gate with a sign directing onward passengers to Fukuoka. This was gate D2 at the end of the terminal, and so it was a long walk to get to Immigration at the other end. Since I have a frequent visitors pass it took less than a minute to get through the formalities and I expected to get my bag and be on the way to my hotel within 30 minutes at most and just missing the start of the evening rush hour traffic. The wait for bags from BKK was interminable. I know Taoyuan can be busy, but after 40 minutes I had had enough. I walked the length of the baggage hall to the CI office. There I was told I was in the wrong terminal! This was totally unbelievable! I then had to walk upstairs, reverse the Immigration process and somehow find the route to Terminal 1. Once there, I was told the Immigration officer at Terminal 2 after voiding my arrival stamp should have returned my entry form which he failed to do. So there was a lot of phoning after which another form had to be completed. By the time I finally got to the the baggage hall, the carousel had stopped and my bag was the only one there. This whole nonsensical process had taken 90 minutes by which time I should have been in my hotel room. The Immigration staff at Taoyuan were efficient and only doing their duty. But for CI to have a flight arrive at the wrong terminal and then fail to ensure that every departing passenger was perfectly aware not only that they had to proceed to a different terminal but that each was directed very clearly to that terminal is an absolute disgrace.

china airlines,Y Gan,2018-10-21,"Ontario to Taipei. China Airlines has a lot to improve. The boarding is the slowest I've ever seen. They just kept pausing the boarding. The cabin looks super nice on its official website yet it was actually not as impressive or comfortable. The seat was the crampest I've ever seen on a long haul flight, I kept moving my back cause it was really uncomfortable. The yellow blanket looks super used. As for the food, again, the worst I've ever seen on a long haul flight. Often I don't expect any nice meal on a coach class, but China Airlines really went too far. You don't even get a dessert like cake, only two side dishes. And the salad was a mess. You should not expect much for the snack in between the meals when flying economy class as well, but saltine crackers, what a joke. The restroom was kind of dirty. EVA, ANA, or Asiana all kept their restroom clean so I don't get why can't China Airlines keeps it at least not dirty. The service was okay, they are neither attentive nor rude. One last thing, just when we arrived at 5, I waited for my checked luggage till 6:30. The bottom line is you China airlines really has a lot to improve.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,no
china airlines,L Bermire,2018-10-11,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Amsterdam via Taipei. Don't fly this airline from Australia / North America through Taipei to Europe. Booked a Premium Economy flight from SYD to AMS for a personal trip. Premium Economy looked very good on their A350s. Only a week after booking they cancelled the SYD to TPE flight on the way out which when challenged, they suggested leaving earlier and having an 18 hour stop in TPE. I got them to book me a hotel, some meals and as the hotel was only for 12 hours, business class lounge access for the final wait, which took a fair bit of persuasion. Then a month before departure they cancelled the return TPE to SYD leg and caused me to stay yet again another 18 hours in TPE. At this point I had had enough but was too close to departure to try and find another Prem Econ ticket anywhere near the price. I tried to persuade them to upgrade me to Business so I could sleep properly, as I was now arriving on a workday and had to go straight to work. They just refused, even though the ticket price difference was 550 Euros, if I was to compare a fresh single ticket Business versus Economy. So they had to book the hotel and meals but this time refused point blank access to the Business Class lounge on the basis they don't run their own lounges in their main hub. Unfortunately, as a non-EU Carrier, they are only liable for delays on flights leaving the EU, so only 1 of the 2 delays was covered, although they are trying to ignore their responsibility at the moment. The planes are nice. The Premium Economy Seat is very big, and when you first sit down, with loads of leg room. However, to recline it, the seat goes forward - a lot! So much so that (and I am not tall, only 1.78m) you cannot fit your feet under the seat in front, so unless you are very short, the complete recline is useless. The food in Premium, unlike most other airlines, is pure Economy, and to be honest even more unappetizing than standard airline food. Their onboard service is questionable to say the least, even in Premium. For example, on 3 out of the 4 flights, they only produced a pre-dinner bar car once, and you had to keep asking for drinks, which might finally arrive. The inflight entertainment is pretty basic unless you are Chinese, luckily, I had a load of Netflix downloaded. All in all, I will never fly them again, and would suggest anyone tempted by decent pricing on tickets, particularly in premium classes, be very careful if flying long haul through Taipei (from Australasia, North America etc) - if the flights are not full, they will drop them and you will be stuck in TPE.

All my baggage are left at the transit. I can understand that that’s because of short transit hour and the airlines told me that’s normal for them. The problem is that I requested the wheel chair and no one picked me up at the transit. This is seriously ridiculous. I was awaiting the wheel chair until the last 5 minutes to the next airplane.

china airlines,Richard Ellis,2018-08-31,"Not Verified |  Sydney to London via Taipei. It was a new A350 plane, with a herringbone business class seat arrangement, meaning that everyone had a private, yet aisle seat. Seats were excellent, fully flat with convenient pockets to store things and wider than some others. The table for meals or laptops etc was very stored under the TV screen, and deployed directly towards the passenger, rather than swivelling out, which is a great improvement on other business class table layouts. The slippers and personal vanity bag contain nothing worth taking off the plane. Service was somewhat functional rather than engaging but a lot of the crew had little English. They were kind and helpful but not very interactive. Food was okay and substantial, but not exceptional. China Airlines seem to be able to leave and arrive at airports on time. All in all a great business class outcome if you aren't fussed about the food and service but want a great seat and on time delivery. The Taipei lounge is good also.

After trying to sleep for a few hours on benches or the floor at 8:30 we were told the flight was cancelled. This was just the beginning. After going through customs and immigration (we never left the country?) We got back to the checkin counters and formed an enormous queue of approximately 300. They had 3-4 ground staff to attempt to rebook all of us on other flights as they were not sure that the aircraft would be ready to fly the next morning. Complete chaos ensued. There was virtually no communication between CA staff and passengers. Finally around 5:50 pm the last of us were confirmed on flights the following day. They begrudgingly gave a few dozen passengers hotel rooms with no food allowance. I lost 2 days in Manila, my final destination and was not offered any compensation for my prepaid hotel room.

We flew Premium Economy this time and were very disappointed. The seats are very comfortable and lots of movies to choose from, but the food and service were average. We had flown from Brisbane to Auckland three days earlier and were fed Fried Rice - no other choice(s) that was it! Coming back it was chicken with mushrooms, rice and vegetables. It was OK, but under seasoned and very bland. My husband cannot eat mushrooms and he eats hardly any vegetables. When he advised the hostess of this she came back with a serve of garlic bread from Business Class. That was his meal! He has a healthy appetite and was not impressed. I would point out that the same meals were being service to Economy Class, so not effort made to provide something a little bit better in Premium Economy. Drinks service limited - one with your meal, and another one just after. That was it. I do not think they were ever offering spirits. They also did not come round offering water on a regular basis, as most airlines. Will definitely go Business Class next time - I do recommend that.",Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,6,5,3,3,4,5,4,yes

china airlines,C Tan ,2018-07-05,"✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Denpasar. After a substandard flight from LHR to Taipei via Amsterdam, I was transferred to Bali. The transfer process in Taipei airport isn’t as easy as other major hubs as it involved a lot of stairs and lifts and a very confusing layout. The CI lounge in T1 was very crowded and it didn’t feel like a hub lounge for a major airlines, and when the main lounge was crowded they sent passengers to a small lounge which felt like a classroom. Outward journey: we left Taipei ontime. Boarding was easy and smooth. To my disappointment it was an old A330 with very dated interior. The seating was comfortable for a 5 hour flight. Entertainment was again very dated. Unlike my experience with their long haul flight, shortfall flights with China Airlines seem to be a different class. All the crew members on this flight was very friendly and approachable, and they didn’t stop providing any food or drink throughout the flight. It was indeed one of the best flights I had in terms of services. Landed in Bali on time but it was a long wait for the luggage. Return journey: check in at Bali was very slow but the agents were all very friendly. Returning flight was a slightly newer plan (A330). Service was again better than most of the long haul flight but definitely not as good as the outbound journey. Arrival at Taipei was very efficient.

china airlines,C Tan ,2018-07-05,"✅ Trip Verified |  OK service, issue with the planes I travelled London Heathrow to Taipei (with onward journey to Bali) in June with China Airlines. It involved a stop over at Amsterdam and the flight between London and Amsterdam was on KLM, while AMS to TPE was on China Airlines. Outbound flight left Amsterdam on time and arrived at Taipei few minutes ahead of schedule. China Airlines use new A350 for its European routes with the exception of Frankfurt. Once I got onboard I immediately noticed that the seat control panel wasn’t working. As a result there were only three possible positions throughout the flight – sit up, relax or flat bed. The table lamp was also disable because of this. I reported to the crew but they didn’t do anything until almost landing. Service was pretty efficient but not particularly warm nor friendly. Returning lag was slightly better. The CI lounge in Taipei terminal 1 was very dark and crowded until late evening. It was renovated 2-3 years ago but has started to show some sign of poor maintenance. The food and drink provided is substandard. Boarding was late by circa 20 minutes but the process was very easy for business class passengers. I was greeted by name by the cabin manager and the team which doesn’t always happen on CI long haul flights. Some of the crew members on this flight were exceptional. However I experienced problem again with the hardware. One of the toilets was out of order which means there was only one toilet for the business class cabin; the window shed in seat 14K was also broken. Seems to me that CI has a lot of maintenance issues. Overall it was a typical China Airlines long haul flight I’d expected. Nothing special and definitely not as good as it main competitor EVA.

china airlines,Michael Spread,2018-05-22,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to London via Taipei. As a family of 2 adults and a 14month old traveling to the UK, a balance of comfort and budget was important and after extensive research, I decided to give China Airlines a try since they’ve opened a 1 stop route SYD - LGW on brand new A350’s with a design awarded business cabin. I’ve flown business to the UK before with Qantas and Malaysian Airlines. Pre flight was simple with online pre-selection of meals, seats and free WiFi offer available but no limo service. Business check in counter and express path for security meant quick transit to the SkyTeam lounge which wasn’t as nice as the Qantas lounge and limited food & bev options. Priority boarding was available and once on board, the choice of the China Airlines business product proved itself to be a good one. The cabin and lighting is excellent, the flat bed seats/suites are modeled on Qatar and are spacious & comfortable. With an evening departure, our son slept with my wife for most of the SYD - TPE leg. A large screen with IFE including Pepper Pig kept him amused for the short time he was awake. Only downside was some language barriers with several stewardesses & western food was below average. TPE airport transit was straight forward with a modern comfortable lounge, baby room and showers along with good Asian food available. TPE - LGW boarded quickly again with priority boarding for business but once on board, the service stood out as better than the prior leg, largely because the cabin staff all spoke better English. The rules are more relaxed on this airline so letting our son play with his toys in the footwell area of my seat when he was awake was a big plus (Qantas would not have allowed this for safety reasons I suspect). Qantas also insist on making your baby sleep with the baby seat belt attachment on which is awkward and unhelpful when he’s already asleep. The food was also better on this leg and Pol Roger 2006 vintage pink champagne was excellent! Overall, My wife and I felt the seat product is superior to Qantas’ new business product which we flew to Hawaii in Nov. the in-flight service & food is inferior but here’s what the compromise gets you and your family, business return to London for 2/3rds of the Qantas cost or most other premium airlines prices. I’m a gold frequent flyer with Qantas but if they can’t get closer in price, I’ll be flying with China Airlines again for the next UK visit.",Family Leisure,Business Class,8,5,3,3,4,3,5,yes

Check in was smooth at a business class only counter. However the CI staff at the information desk was very rude to passengers making enquirers. Not a best representation of the company. It was very disappointing that as a business class passenger there is no dedicated lane for security and immigration. Security queue for both T1 (China Airlines) and T2 (EVA and China) tend to be long and neither airlines have special facilities for their business class passengers. The lounge in Taipei T1 (CI Dynasty lounge, the one closer to Gate A) was ok. It has no window but the design was classic. Food and drink choices were lacking. Boarding was announced in the lounge and there was a business class only bridge so you can skip the queue even if you are late at the gate. Service on this sector was significantly improved. I was offerred food and wine menu and was told that I should be able to change my food choice if I wanted to (I had pre-ordered online). The cabin manager introduced herself and offered a warm welcome. Again attention to details/amenities/food and drink were not as great as its main competitor EVA but this is partly compensated by the brand new airplane. Despite not offering full duvet and turn down service, sleep quality was good. The entertainment system also worked well. I personally found the onboard lounge on A350 a waste of space. I was told by the cabin manager that the lounge on 777 was larger and served its purpose and unfortunately it is not the case on A350. Business class passengers also only have 1 toilet (there are actually 2 but the other is frequented by passengers on deluxe economy).

china airlines,C Tan,2018-02-28,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Taipei. I haven't flown China Airlines for 20 years primarily due to their poor safety record in the 90s and also due to lack of network in Europe. After they launched direct flight to London I decided to take the opportunity and fly  back to Taiwan for lunar new year. I booked it through online travel agent and it was easy. However China Airlines website is difficult to navigate. Menu pre selection is not shown on your main profile, and entertainment was on another website. Nevertheless the online check in process was very easy. At London Gatwick the ground service is handled by a 3rd party company. They are very courteous and friendly. The lounge was No. 1 at the South Terminal. Nothing fancy but did it work. Boarding was well organised as business passengers were invited to take a seat near the bridge. The flight in the business class section was empty. 8 passengers occupied the entire 32 seats. Immediate reaction was the airplane was spotless and clean, while service was lacking. They only offered soft drinks before take off. It was noticeable how quiet the A350 was - far better than 777 and it was very spacious. The entertainment was good - large screen, good choices of movie and a lot of interaction function. The seat was  comfortable. What fell short (well, when being compared with EVA which is its main competitors) is the ambition to deliver a full service. On EVA you have great amenity, pajama, great selection of wines and food and service was second to none. On China Airlines it feels they are just doing their job without going extra mile. The biggest disappointment is the layout of the A350. There are 32 seats but there is only 1 toilet in the front of the airplane plus one at the rear of the business class section which is often visited by passengers in Premium Economy. Overall it's a ok flight but nothing really stands out. If the price is right I will still fly with China Airlines as it saves few hours and I really like A350; otherwise I would prefer EVA Air or Cathay Pacific over China Airlines.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,5,4,2,2,3,5,4,yes

Did not travel with check-in luggage so the only interaction I had with staff on the ground was at the gate. I checked in on-line and needed to get my boarding card printed. This was done promptly and I was directed to board the aircraft. Cabin in Business was clean, neat and looked well maintained. Cabin staff were very professional, used my name and ensured that I had all I required but were not intrusive. Sat in 12K on this leg of the journey, found the ambient temperature too hot, 180 degree flatbed was unfortunately wasted on this leg as couldn't sleep comfortably at that temperature. Arrived in Taipei with a 4hr wait, used the lounge which was comfortable and staff were pleasant, a few of them spoke English which helped. Used the shower facility which was clean. Boarded flight leg to AMS on time, flight left on time as did previous leg. Filled out my breakfast request, put my bed into flat position and fell asleep. Ambient temperature was lower and I slept really well, right through the dinner service. Was in seat 11A on this leg and was wondering to myself whether being in the second row from the front of the aircraft had any influence on the temperature. Seating starts at row 10 on China Airlines A350. When I woke up about 6hrs later, the staff were apologising for not serving me dinner, had to assure them that i was alright, they brought me biscuits and green tea.

Not one of them acknowledged I was pregnant or bothered to help me get my bags into the overhead compartment, whenever I talked to staff there was thinly veiled contempt in their gaze, demeanor and voices. I was not a customer but problem. As an Australian I have never been treated like this by any other airline. On embarkation the cabin was thick with the smell of body odor, unclean, musty. The seats are crammed in like sardines and the food is disgusting. It was a read eye flight and they kept the lights on and fed us dinner at 2am when all I wanted to do was sleep, the flight was super bumpy and I did not feel safe with the condition of the inside of the plane surely making me wonder about the maintenance of the plane mechanics.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
china airlines,S Meaden,2018-01-13,"✅ Trip Verified |  Rome to Auckland via Taipei. Boarded in Rome, found my seat noticed a blanket on the seat not in a plastic bag. Opened it out and it was covered in black hairs. Found a flight attendant to ask for new blanket, and she said ""oh that's been used"" I had to ask for a clean one that came in a bag. The food was very bland I made the mistake and ordered vegetarian oriental, flavourless! The crew did not want to be there, they were remote in their expressions and service. When I asked for another water or apple juice they seemed annoyed that I asked. After the 9 hour layover in Taipei we were then directed to an Airbus A330 in my opinion far too small for a long haul flight to Brisbane. It was cramped, as in knees hitting the seat in front, and really uncomfortable. The on board IFE (inflight entertainment) screen was the size of a small paper back book, again not suitable for viewing a movie on a long haul flight. The crew were also detached on this flight as well. I don't expect the Crown Jewels when we fly but some sort of basic service is all one would expect. We would never ever fly China Airlines again, yes it was a good price but we got what we paid for. I feel I am not being harsh, I was a flight attendant for many years, service and a smile was number one priority.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,2,1,1,1,2,3,1,no
china airlines,E Lee,2018-01-10,"✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Nanjing via Taipei. I was 6 months pregnant when I flew China airlines. My husband and I requested for the priority seat which has more space when we checked in, the assistant told us she selected the front spacious seats for us. When we arrive the airplane we found out she put us in the middle of 4 seats row, where it’s hard for me to get up and go to toilet. We spoke with the staff on airline for help and they are rude and didn’t help us at all. It was a 9 hours fly trip and my legs & hands are super swollen. I will not fly with China airlines any more. It’s a nightmare for me!",Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,no
china airlines,Shauna Whelan,2018-01-07,"✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Sydney via Taipei. Do not fly with China Airlines - Just moved to Sydney with my friend where we left Dublin on the 3rd January and due to the airline we only arrived yesterday, the 5th so it took us 2 days when it should have taken 26 hours! There were delays on every single flight and when we got to Taipei we had to wait 14 hours to get a connection fight due to a delay in Amsterdam because the GPS on the plane was broken for 3 hours (sitting on the runway). When we arrived at Sydney we had no bags and were told they would arrive today, the 6th by 2pm, we still have no bags and it’s 9pm! When we asked to get seats together after sever delays this wasn’t even possible which was a joke! Worst customer service ever! I will never fly with them again!",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,1,2,1,,,1,2,no
china airlines,T Wen,2018-01-02,"✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Singapore. Cabin was dated but clean with seats with generous legroom and recline despite the presence of an entertainment box under all seats. Flight attendants weren't the most friendly but did their jobs well, serving refreshments and snacks. The food tasted pretty good, the chicken tasted fresh. Portions need to increase (they were about the size of my passport) IFE was very bad. It probably hasn't been upgraded since the day it was installed way back in 2005. Its resolution was so low that viewing a movie on it was torture. Its touch screen was so unresponsive that I had to literally jab it to get the screen to recognise my touch. Its only redeeming factor was its wide selecton of movies. Bring your on entertainment when going on CAL's regional A330s.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,7,5,3,4,2,4,4,yes
china airlines,Michelle Valencia,2017-12-30,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Surabaya. The staff at check-in was so rude. I asked for the front seat and she just replied “no more.” I knew the flight is not full, it’s just because she is lazy to re-print. Than she asked to weigh my bag, it weigh almost 11KG yet I traveled with 3 of us and 1 hand luggage. She said it should be checked-in also, but it’s all laptop & camera, how you check-in them? She and her colleagues were arrogant like see me like she was underestimating me. And then she changed my seats to the front lines.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,1,1,1,,,1,1,no
