## Gabriel Choo, SG DSI 14

Objectives:
1. Using Reddit's API, you'll collect posts from two subreddits of your choosing.
2. Use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem.

### Problem Statement
Reddit has two subreddits call Askmen and AskWomen. As these subreddits contents and target audiences are largely different in nature, how can we differentiate which subreddits each new post belongs to?

### Executive Summary
